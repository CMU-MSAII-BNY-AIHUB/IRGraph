0,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,"Sure. Alex, let me -- I'll start on the first dynamic of organic growth. It was a strong organic growth period. And I think both year-over-year and then sequentially, it was nice to see we had organic growth, both in the C&IS business and used it at a high level. It was a little over 1% of pure net new business that contributed to the growth in C&IS. And then we also had overall positive growth in the -- from an organic perspective in the Wealth Management side of the business. And you don't see it, but the asset management business on its own also provided some positive organic growth, which is nice to see. A lot of it was driven by very strong movement into cash. I was looking at over the weekend, I think there was over $30 billion in flows overall into that category. 
And our NIF treasury fund is #1 in its peer group and investment performance. And just that set of funds alone has AUM of over $60 billion right now. So in a lot of ways, things are going well. I think it's also important, just take a second to think about some of the interactions we've had with our business. And this, I think, feeds into your question about how we should think about this in the longer term. And just take Wealth Management, for example, I was talking to some of the leaders there and just some interesting notes. One, their call report volume, just activity with clients has really skyrocketed. Over 100% increase in call reports just from our central region, just gives a sense of the activity there. We do these webinars to teach clients about and talk more from our experts about what's going on. We typically get about 800 or 900 people show up for those virtually. And they're at record levels now. 
There's over 3,000 people consistently coming into that. And then even the marketing material, we've -- we track things as granularly as the page views that we get from the marketing material we send out, that's -- that averages about 1,200 page views. And over the last several weeks, we've been averaging 6,000 to 10,000. And so I think in the short run, it was interesting to see that we were able to actually close good pieces of new business that was already in the pipeline. I think the very long-term bodes very well for us, given some of the statistics just throughout the engagement we've had with clients. I think if there's an area of caution, it's going to be in that midterm pipeline. 
I think there's just not as few clients that are going to be spinning up new opportunities, whether it's on the C&IS side, they feel the same way, or the wealth side. So I think we're going to close all the business that we can that was already in kind of the one not funded late in the pipeline. And I think the long-term looks very good, and we can talk about the more countercyclical dynamics of outsourcing that lead into help on the new business side for C&IS, but the long-term feels good. I think the short term, we obviously have to be cautious about. 
And then on the expenses, I'll start, but maybe Mike or Mark will join in. As we think about that, we want to bucket it in a few different categories. And probably the best way to think about it might even be just to look through -- if you go to Page 7 of the earnings release, that outlines expenses pretty well and in more detail. And first of all, we had a long list of different paths we could take on this from just saying, ""let's let expenses play through"" to ""let's go ahead and do a full replan of expenses, "" and we took the latter approach. We took a very aggressive detailed approach to unwrapping our expenses based on what we knew the environment was going to look like in the short run, at least. 
And so we un-bucketed things the way we traditionally do: inflation, productivity, business growth and investments. And we've been very aggressive at outlining where we can address expenses. Then if you look at Page 7, the areas that are more related to client activity or markets have to do with outside services and equipment and software. And super high level, roughly, you get kind of 30% to 40% of those have that type -- they have some correlation to markets and new business. Those are the areas we've been laser-focused on. But even on IT investment, we're just rerationalizing everything that we've committed to do."
0,2,"Chairman, President & CEO",Michael G. Oâ€™Grady,"Yes, this is Mike. I would just add to what Jason said that there are near-term actions that we've already taken and continue -- can continue to take, which definitely looks to bring down the expense run rate from where we were in the fourth quarter and then where we are now. And then just given that the world has changed and will change, there are new opportunities for productivity over the long term. I mean if you think about real estate costs and other costs that come with having everybody in facilities versus now, as I mentioned earlier, we're roughly 90% people working from home. It's not going to stay at that level, but I also don't think the operating model will be the same once we get through this."
1,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,"Sure, Glenn. Well, let me just start with some of the assumptions that went into the forecast. And I think, like a lot of firms, we -- the SEC is very specific in saying, you've got to pick it -- use your end-of-period date, use your forecast at that point to drive your increase or decrease in reserves. And so we obviously follow that. If you look at right at the end of the period, we were looking at unemployment of 10%. We had a peak-to-trough change in GDP of just over 6%. And then as you likely know, that's not it. It's not like we have those assumptions and then it spits out the $61 million provision number. We have a variety -- dozens of factors that go from there. 
And from the number of forecast that we use, the weights and the priorities of those forecasts. The downgrade assumptions of the underlying credits, which drive the expected loss assumptions. And so you go through a very rigorous governance process to take the output of the forecast and the model to drive to a final number for provision. Now after we did that, like all other financial firms, we went through a new forecasting period. The economic inputs in the market were changing dramatically. We're watching that closely. So within the next couple of weeks, we went through a forecast that went to an unemployment peak of 14.5% and peak-to-trough GDP change of 7.5%. And so that gives an indication that directionally, the provision number, if we were to go through that same governance process, would have yielded a higher provision number at that point. 
Now that said, we didn't go through that same finalization of the governance process after that second forecast was run. We could do that every day. But it's very -- it's a very rigorous process, but we follow the letter of what the SEC and what the accounting guidelines provide us to do. And so we will continue to do those updates as we always do with our forecasting process, and we'll have that rigorous process added to it as we get into the next reporting period. 
And then if we want to touch on the loan book itself, we -- why don't we go through some headlines on it, I'll start and then maybe Mark can jump in. I think the key is the -- it's -- there's no dramatic difference between what we've told you before about the loan portfolio and what it is today. There's a lot of other even qualitative assumptions that go into that -- the number that drives the CECL accounting provision number but why don't we provide a little bit more information. So Mark, I'll turn it over to you for that."
1,1,Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations,Mark M. Bette,"Yes. Looking at the entire loan portfolio, over 20% of the loans are to private clients, secured by marketable securities primarily. And those are primarily custody to Northern Trust. You do have about 20% of the portfolio, which is residential real estate. Again, the nature of those obligors is somewhat unique. I mean for example, over 75% of those would have FICO scores of 740 or higher. 
When you start to look at the commercial and the commercial real estate, the commercial is predominantly investment grade. And on the commercial real estate side, the lending is to investors as opposed to developers. And over 95% of those commercial real estate loans have personal guarantees as well. So pretty high quality. When we look at the C&I portfolio as far as where the high impact or low impacts might be from the current situation that we find ourselves in. We would say we're very much predominantly in what we would hope is in the lower impact when we look at the kind of industry segmentation there."
2,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,"Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll start. Well, first of all, the more time we spend around NII, I think what jumps out to me is that the key is actually less the size of the balance sheet, which is driven so much by the deposit growth. It has much more to do with what's happening with loan volume. And if you think about it, the size of the balance sheet and the size of average earning assets is going to be dominated by client deposits coming on. And on a different interest rate environment, that's going to have an impact on NII. And -- but in the short run, you think about it on an incremental basis, we're not investing those deposits long, and we're not investing them with credit risk either. 
And so the dynamic there is that effectively you're bringing -- the size is driven by deposits that are going to be reinvested a lot in IOER at 10 basis points. And maybe something -- a little somewhat different than that, but not dramatically. The things that are going to drive NII more, are going to be really 2 things: one, the volume of loans; and then secondly, we've talked about this before, but the spread of 1-month LIBOR to the bottom end of Fed funds or IOER, very important. 
And it really gives you a sense of the NII impact of a lot of the earning assets and how those are going to behave and contribute to NII. And so those are the -- those are really the big factors. And so I mentioned that because I think it's just important to decouple and not try and predict NII based on where that 1.51% in NIM is going to go. I think you have to have more of a bottoms-up approach of thinking about particularly loans and then what is LIBOR going to do. LIBOR has been coming down a couple of basis points a day effectively and where you think that the trajectory there is going to go is a very important factor."
3,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,"Sure. So just to start with the end. It's actually -- I think it's a little higher than that. It's about 80% of the loan book is actually floating at this point. And that's tied very mostly to LIBOR. And then to what our assumptions are, the down 7% to 10% number we provided is reflective of a tightening of the spread between LIBOR and IOER. And so we've looked at that and continue to think that that's going to compress a decent amount. 
On a spot basis, I haven't looked at it this morning, but last week, it was kind of that LIBOR at kind of 70, 72 basis points against an IOER of 10 and we think that could continue to narrow a fair amount. And if you think about where LIBOR was just a couple of weeks ago, it's significantly higher than that. And so we certainly feel like that's got to be part of any projection."
4,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,"Yes. Thank you, Ken. And yes, we've -- we're reinvesting short, is the quick answer to the question. And we want to -- we don't feel that there's potential -- that the potential need from clients to have very spiky, aggressive needs and desires to be on the balance sheet is necessarily over. And so we want to make sure we've got plenty of dry powder and plenty of capacity for them on both the loans and deposits side. 
And so we're taking a short-term approach of being there for our clients. Now our duration, I think at the beginning of last year of '19, probably, it was around 1.1. We had stepped that out. We told the investment community. We were going to step it out. We've gotten all the way out to about 2. 
And since then, very recently, as we're reinvesting maturing securities, that will come in a little bit as we position the portfolio to maintain maximum capacity. That's not reflective of a long-term strategy, but it is reflective of our desire to be there for clients in the short run."
4,1,Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations,Mark M. Bette,"Yes, the split between the shorter securities book and the longer. We've -- it's been running closer to 50-50 historically. I think more recently, the longer book was a little larger. And then as Jason said, as we reinvest depending on where those reinvestments go, that could shift a little bit. But in balance, a little bit tilted towards the longer side of where it was on average during the quarter."
4,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,"Yes. And the funding side, we think of is more 50-50, and we try and stay matched on that reflectively on the reinvestment side. I think as we continue to go shorter, in the near term, that's going to lean a little bit more short, but in the long run, it's about kind of maintaining that -- maintaining the hedge."
5,2,"Chairman, President & CEO",Michael G. Oâ€™Grady,"Yes. Mike, this is Mike. In the way that we thought about the operating model over time, it's never been one that we thought in a stabilized way that we would be at 90% working outside the facilities. Frankly, what we've learned through this crisis is that we can meet client needs and be able to operate the business, execute the business even at that high level of remote working. Having said that, I -- this is not the level that we want to sustain. We'll have to be careful as we have people return to the office. That will happen in a phased approach. But frankly, longer term, as I mentioned, I think that there are opportunities because if you even went beyond just the ability to serve our clients and think about efficiency, we may have lost some efficiency during this time period. 
But frankly, it's also I would say, demonstrated that there are inefficiencies in having everybody come in and out of the facilities around the globe. And that there is certain work that is easier to have our partners, our employees do remotely. Or even if it's not completely remotely, do they come into a facility for a portion of the week? Things like that. And that also aligns with some of the things we've been doing over time about our workspaces. It's as you would expect, it's not all about everybody having an office or even a cubicle, it's more about open spaces and flexible workspaces and things like that. 
And that sits in with not having everybody reporting into the office at the same time. So we don't have the complete long-term operating model at this point. But again, I don't believe it will go back to the way it was. And I think, frankly, it will present opportunities for both greater efficiency and, I think, for our employees, additional satisfaction on their overall work life."
6,2,"Chairman, President & CEO",Michael G. Oâ€™Grady,"Yes. So at a high level, the exposure to energy is very, very low. And a lot of our -- we've got a lot of clients that had garnered their wealth from the industry, but our lending exposure, specifically to oil and gas is very, very low."
7,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,"Yes. Sure. So if we come back to that framework, that page, I'll give you a little bit more of how I think about the subcategories in there. So the outside services and some -- the headlines, some of these things are going to be mixed. Some we'll be able to moderate lower and some are -- we're going to have more activity as we've invested to make sure that we've got good operational resiliency. 
And so within outside services, for example, a lot of that is consulting and legal costs. Well, on the consulting side, there are going to be projects that we had planned to do when we went through our original planning process that don't necessarily chin the bar at this point or that we're just going to delay for a period of time or that we're going to do with a reduced scope. And so those are the types of conversations we have there. 
On legal, we actually hinted very quickly, I think, in the script that we've had some benefits, some things go our way on some legal matters. And so that's part of the benefit that we've had in there. If you think about equipment and software, it's an interesting line item because even within there, there are items that will go both ways. We've also invested more heavily in infrastructure there. But at the same time, that's where there are some capital IT projects that we might not do. 
And then there's also an overlay on both of these, where we have to think about what's related to the core business, either from an assets perspective or just client activity. Things like market data, third-party advisory fees, sub-custody, brokerage clearing. Those are the -- some of those line items that will add up to that kind of roughly 30% to 40% number that we're thinking about. 
And then in occupancy, just to refresh your memory on some of the things we've talked about, we had already been in late stages of some larger transitions and investments and we talked about the fact that in the short run, we might have some overlap in rent and investment, and we think that's going to peak around second quarter. And then we should get the benefit of that more in the second half of the year."
8,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,"Well, I think that in the -- there's 2 competing factors there. One is our desire in the short run to make sure that we're maximizing loan capacity effectively for our clients. I think, but in the longer run, this base of business is based on deposits that's more core, we'll be able to invest in a better way. The counter to that is that the duration that we built in the portfolio will start to dissipate. And so the more we're reinvesting of the portfolio that we had coming into this year, the more we're going to experience the impact of lower nominal rates. 
And even so -- even if we're taking longer duration and to -- even if we're extending the portfolio from a reinvestment perspective, we'll be doing so with -- in a lower interest rate environment. And so that -- those competing factors will operate. And I think it's up to everybody to have their own determinations of what they think the interest rate environment is going to look like in the immediate -- in the intermediate term."
9,1,Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations,Mark M. Bette,"Yes. Brian, this is Mark. So yes, it's pretty similar to what we've said before. So with custody and fund administration, first, and this is in C&IS, there's about 35% to 40%, call it, 40% of fees that are not asset-value sensitive. So that's the first part. Of the fees that are asset value sensitive, so the remaining 60%, about 3/4 of those are a month lag and 1/4 of them are quarter lag, which is similar to what we've -- what we would have updated a year ago. 
I think last time, we had a change in markets when we gave that update. And then remember, as far as the asset sensitive, it's not all equity exposure because we have an allocation across multiple asset classes. When you get to the Wealth Management side, I would probably divide it between the regions and the global family office. The global family office business, you're right. There is a -- that is probably more leaned toward the quarter lag. It's similar to the asset servicing business and C&IS. And there's also about 1/4 of those fees that aren't asset-sensitive, more like what you see on the asset servicing side of C&IS. 
And the regions, and I would combine the regions together, then you're looking at about 3/4 or more of those fees being a month lag. So hopefully, that gives you an idea. Not a significant change, though, from what we've said before there."
9,7,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,Okay. That's perfect. And then just -- I just missed the comment on the GDP assumption that you had in the -- for the credit provisions. If you could just reiterate that?
9,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,Sure. So the baseline that we went with for the March 31 for the reporting cycle had peak to trough down a little over 6% -- 6.1%. And then the update subsequent to that is it's down 7.5%.
10,2,"Chairman, President & CEO",Michael G. Oâ€™Grady,"Sure, Betsy, it's Mike. I'll add on to what Jason said earlier. So it's -- if you think about the flow of new business, there's business that we've won. And it's a matter of transitioning that business on. And one of the things that, again, I want to give credit to our team on, is the fact that even in the month of March, with everything that happened, we were able to transition the majority of the business that was scheduled to be transitioned. So in that sense, that's why we say, right now, that will look good. 
Having said that, there are new mandates that were to transition in April, for example, or May or June, that it's not only that we're in, I'll call it, the work-from-home mode, but that the clients are as well. And so they've said, ""Let's move our transition back further."" So they're deferred transitions. So when Jason talked about in the medium term, that would be new business that would come on, for example, in the second or the third quarter that now has been moved back. 
And then if you then also think about what's happening with the client base, certainly winning new clients is new business for us, but it's also the flow activity that they have, whether that's an institutional client and what they're doing with their funds. Are they more in a spending mode, if you will, utilizing mode, if they're a sovereign wealth fund, that's being impacted by the environment? Or if they're an asset manager, are they a part of the market that is a net gainer of flows or a net outflow? And that, of course, then will impact us as well. 
And then the last piece is just, well, what about new business activity where you're in the process of winning? Yes. There's some slowdown in, I would say, mandate-type decisions. But also with a lot of activity like this, we do see plenty of our clients that are saying, we've been talking about outsourcing for some time period, whether that's the whole middle office, or that's trading. 
You know what, now that we've gone through this time period, we can see that you're in a better position to do that for us than for us to do on our own. So let's continue that dialogue. And then we can figure out when we'll decide to do it and hopefully do it with us as well. And so that happens. That's why we say, longer term, we see a lot of opportunities. But that's not going to impact the third or fourth quarter of this year."
11,2,"Chairman, President & CEO",Michael G. Oâ€™Grady,"Well, I appreciate the historical perspective on that going back to 2001. And I would say as far as the nature of how we think about credit, it's still very similar. I mean it's aligned with our overall business and with holistic relationships. So that has not changed. And specifically to clients where we are the custodian for their pension plans, we often then are participating in their credit facilities. 
Now when you look at that portfolio of companies, it still goes through a very rigorous credit process. And so it's a very high-quality set of companies as well and high-quality set of credits. There's no way that we can necessarily predict which sectors are going to be impacted by a particular stress scenario. And so we wouldn't make the type of statement to say and we have no exposures to any sectors that are troubled right now. Certainly, we do. But all of that, we try to manage the size of the exposures for that. And that's just -- you've just identified one area, which is on the corporate side. Certainly, we work with asset managers. 
So we're providing credit to the different types of asset managers. And then on the wealth side, the nature of where wealth is developed. And so that can either be the companies that are owned by families, but also the individual credit needs. As Mark mentioned, about 20% of our portfolio overall is basically margin lending. It's collateralized by their investment portfolio. And so that would reflect the nature of that credit needs for that part of the client base."
12,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,Not sure I have it as handy. Why don't we...
12,1,Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations,Mark M. Bette,"Yes, we can follow up with you, I mean..."
12,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,Because it's available...
12,1,Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations,Mark M. Bette,"A lot of that would be public on the Northern Funds, Northern Institutional Funds website, but we could follow up with that, Brennan."
13,2,"Chairman, President & CEO",Michael G. Oâ€™Grady,"Sure. Mark, do you want to..."
13,1,Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations,Mark M. Bette,"Yes. Steven, I can try to take that. So it is a hard one because there is a lot that moves around within that category. I guess one way that I've kind of talked about, I think even on the last call, we kind of talked about it. Certainly, you have BOLI that has come in incrementally in each of the last 4 quarters, with this quarter being about $13 million. 
So if you took BOLI out as well as some of the things that we've had like last quarter, we had a lease loss of $20.8 million. If you adjust taking BOLI out the last 4 quarters and adjust for the things we've called out, and you kind of did the math, you're probably looking at an average run rate of, call it, $33 million, $34 million. And then in theory, you could then say, ""Okay, well, let me add the full run rate of BOLI in and add $13 million to that."" So maybe that gets you to the $45 million, $47 million range. 
I would just caution, though, it is a very -- there is volatility in that line. So it's a hard one. There's things like currency hedging that flows through that line. We've talked about some of the things that this quarter, some of the marks might flow through that line. The Visa-related income-expense type of swap marks flow through that line as well. So it certainly does move around. But if you looked at it over a longer period, you could use that potentially as kind of an average run rate."
