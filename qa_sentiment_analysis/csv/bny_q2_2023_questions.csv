0,5,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",Brennan  Hawken,"Dermot, I'd like to start with which you just touched on, the unchanged NII outlook. Curious what you're seeing as far as deposit cost pressure. We've begun to see that emerge. There are peer firms of Bank of New York's that have flagged some upward pressure in the back book. How is it that you are able to avoid these pressures and keep on your NII outlook that you had provided earlier?"
1,3,"Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division",Alexander  Blostein,"Just a quick follow-up first maybe around the deposit discussion. So Dermot, if I hear you correctly, no kind of catch-up from the back book that you expect to see in your deposit pricing for the rest of the year. But I guess, if we look at the deposit beta over the course of this quarter, it looks like it was pretty close to 100% on a currency adjusted basis. Maybe help us break down the deposit cost in U.S. and non-U.S. and maybe the type of -- what kind of deposit pressure and client conversations are you seeing in the kind of different regions?"
2,4,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division",Betsy Lynn Graseck,"I know we talked a lot about deposits, but I did just want to drill down on how you're thinking about the life of the deposits. And is that at all changed versus history? And part of the reason for asking is just trying to understand if there's any impact on the securities portfolio as you put that deposit flow to work."
3,13,"Wolfe Research, LLC",Steven Joseph Chubak,"So wanted to dig into noninterest-bearing deposits. They're now firmly within your 20% to 25% guidance or target range. Your peers have offered more conservative guidance on NIB deposit trends. I know some of your businesses and your mix is pretty unique or idiosyncratic, but I wanted to just better understand what's driving the resiliency in NIB trends and your confidence level at that 20% to 25% range is still appropriate."
4,9,"Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division",Glenn Paul Schorr,"So the FedNow platform has started for interbank payments. I'm assuming you're going to be playing a big role in this, but I'm curious what you think the expected impact for the industry and for BK is? Like these things are usually good for expenses, good for capital efficiency but bad for revenue. But I'm just curious if you can tell us what you think?"
5,7,"BofA Securities, Research Division",Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala,"Just had a follow-up, Dermot, on the NII side. So heard everything that you talked about. You've done a good job in terms of forecasting NII and depositor behavior. Give us a sense of if we don't get any rate cuts over the next 12 months, where does NII trough, given the repricing on the security side that you expect and assuming no big surprises on deposits relative to your current expectations. Just is there a natural trough to NII without -- before we bake into it any Fed moves?"
6,10,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",Kenneth Michael Usdin,"Just a follow-up, to your point about being able to beat that expense expectation for the year and in reaction to a little bit different outcome on the fees than initially expected, I just wonder if you could just talk to us about both sides of that. Number one, the beating on the expense side, is that doing anything incremental in terms of either the severance effects or delaying investments? Or is it just the core? 
And on the fees side, I'm just wondering if you can kind of catalog for us which businesses have underperformed a little bit. And do you have a better line of sight for a better rate or change for those going forward?"
7,6,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",Brian Bertram Bedell,"Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But maybe just a follow-on on the 1BNY Mellon initiative. Maybe on the revenue side of that, it sounds like, obviously, there's a lot of low-hanging fruit on the cost side that will run well over the next 1 to 2 years. But on the revenue side of that, I guess, how would you -- just in a comparison perspective relative to expenses, how would you cite the revenue potential for 1BNY over the next couple of years? And if you can point to any one early example of cross-sell traction."
8,8,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",Gerard Sean Cassidy,"Dermot, earlier Robin pointed out that, obviously, there's going to be a lot of Treasury issuance in the second half of the year. Could you guys quantify the benefit or the monetary benefit that you'll see from this type of issuance because you're the primary clearer of Treasuries, of course? Is there any way of quantifying that for us?"
9,12,Autonomous Research US LP,Robert Henry Wildhack,"I wanted to go back to the theme of fees versus expenses and drill down a little bit into Securities Services and the margin in there. I mean, what portion of the margin improvement you're aiming for do you think will come from sheer expense discipline? And then what portion do you think comes from all the fee opportunities that you're speaking to?"
10,11,"Morningstar Inc., Research Division",Rajiv K. Bhatia,"Just on that Pershing business, can you remind us how much of your revenue is from RIA custody side? And then can you talk about what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint? Goldman Sachs seems to be expanding in this area. Envestnet has partnered with FNZ. SEI has also made some moves here. So curious how you see the competitive landscape evolving."
