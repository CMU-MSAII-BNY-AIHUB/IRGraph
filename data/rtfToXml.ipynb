      "Sure. Alex, let me -- I'll start on the first dynamic of organic growth. It was a strong organic growth period. And I think both year-over-year and then sequentially, it was nice to see we had organic growth, both in the C&IS business and used it at a high level. It was a little over 1% of pure net new business that contributed to the growth in C&IS. And then we also had overall positive growth in the -- from an organic perspective in the Wealth Management side of the business. And you don't see it, but the asset management business on its own also provided some positive organic growth, which is nice to see. A lot of it was driven by very strong movement into cash. I was looking at over the weekend, I think there was over $30 billion in flows overall into that category. \n",

So in a lot of ways, things are going well. I think it's also important, just take a second to think about some of the interactions we've had with our business. And this, I think, feeds into your question about how we should think about this in the longer term. And just take Wealth Management, for example, I was talking to some of the leaders there and just some interesting notes. One, their call report volume, just activity with clients has really skyrocketed. Over 100% increase in call reports just from our central region, just gives a sense of the activity there. We do these webinars to teach clients about and talk more from our experts about what's going on. We typically get about 800 or 900 people show up for those virtually. And they're at record levels now. \n",

And over the last several weeks, we've been averaging 6,000 to 10,000. And so I think in the short run, it was interesting to see that we were able to actually close good pieces of new business that was already in the pipeline. I think the very long-term bodes very well for us, given some of the statistics just throughout the engagement we've had with clients. I think if there's an area of caution, it's going to be in that midterm pipeline. \n",

So I think we're going to close all the business that we can that was already in kind of the one not funded late in the pipeline. And I think the long-term looks very good, and we can talk about the more countercyclical dynamics of outsourcing that lead into help on the new business side for C&IS, but the long-term feels good. I think the short term, we obviously have to be cautious about. \n",

      "And then on the expenses, I'll start, but maybe Mike or Mark will join in. As we think about that, we want to bucket it in a few different categories. And probably the best way to think about it might even be just to look through -- if you go to Page 7 of the earnings release, that outlines expenses pretty well and in more detail. And first of all, we had a long list of different paths we could take on this from just saying, \"let's let expenses play through\" to \"let's go ahead and do a full replan of expenses, \" and we took the latter approach. We took a very aggressive detailed approach to unwrapping our expenses based on what we knew the environment was going to look like in the short run, at least. \n",

      "And so we un-bucketed things the way we traditionally do: inflation, productivity, business growth and investments. And we've been very aggressive at outlining where we can address expenses. Then if you look at Page 7, the areas that are more related to client activity or markets have to do with outside services and equipment and software. And super high level, roughly, you get kind of 30% to 40% of those have that type -- they have some correlation to markets and new business. Those are the areas we've been laser-focused on. But even on IT investment, we're just rerationalizing everything that we've committed to do. \n",

I would just add to what Jason said that there are near-term actions that we've already taken and continue -- can continue to take, which definitely looks to bring down the expense run rate from where we were in the fourth quarter and then where we are now. And then just given that the world has changed and will change, there are new opportunities for productivity over the long term. I mean if you think about real estate costs and other costs that come with having everybody in facilities versus now, as I mentioned earlier, we're roughly 90% people working from home. It's not going to stay at that level, but I also don't think the operating model will be the same once we get through this. \n",

And I don't want to put words in your guys' mouth too, maybe just to clarify, I guess, in the past, you talked about expense growth aligning with organic fee growth and in the near term, organic fee growth, it sounds like it's obviously going to moderate pretty considerably. So should we think about the total expense business expense base being flattish year-over-year? Or is there a way to bring that down? Just hoping to get some more granularity. \n",

And so yes, as that comes down, the fee growth comes down, the organic expense growth rate comes down as well.

And then if we could talk about the loan book that produce most of that. I'm assuming it's almost all-in C&I and CRE. So maybe you could talk about what in, say, office, retail and construction, where that is derived from? How much of it is clients that are across the firm versus some things that are syndicated?

And I think, like a lot of firms, we -- the SEC is very specific in saying, you've got to pick it -- use your end-of-period date, use your forecast at that point to drive your increase or decrease in reserves. And so we obviously follow that. If you look at right at the end of the period, we were looking at unemployment of 10%. We had a peak-to-trough change in GDP of just over 6%. And then as you likely know, that's not it. It's not like we have those assumptions and then it spits out the $61 million provision number. We have a variety -- dozens of factors that go from there. \n",

And so you go through a very rigorous governance process to take the output of the forecast and the model to drive to a final number for provision. Now after we did that, like all other financial firms, we went through a new forecasting period. The economic inputs in the market were changing dramatically. We're watching that closely. So within the next couple of weeks, we went through a forecast that went to an unemployment peak of 14.5% and peak-to-trough GDP change of 7.5%. And so that gives an indication that directionally, the provision number, if we were to go through that same governance process, would have yielded a higher provision number at that point. \n",

      "Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll start. Well, first of all, the more time we spend around NII, I think what jumps out to me is that the key is actually less the size of the balance sheet, which is driven so much by the deposit growth. It has much more to do with what's happening with loan volume. And if you think about it, the size of the balance sheet and the size of average earning assets is going to be dominated by client deposits coming on. And on a different interest rate environment, that's going to have an impact on NII. And -- but in the short run, you think about it on an incremental basis, we're not investing those deposits long, and we're not investing them with credit risk either. \n",

And maybe something -- a little somewhat different than that, but not dramatically. The things that are going to drive NII more, are going to be really 2 things: one, the volume of loans; and then secondly, we've talked about this before, but the spread of 1-month LIBOR to the bottom end of Fed funds or IOER, very important. \n",

And so those are the -- those are really the big factors. And so I mentioned that because I think it's just important to decouple and not try and predict NII based on where that 1.51% in NIM is going to go. I think you have to have more of a bottoms-up approach of thinking about particularly loans and then what is LIBOR going to do. LIBOR has been coming down a couple of basis points a day effectively and where you think that the trajectory there is going to go is a very important factor. \n",

And yet, if you -- if someone thought it was all about the facilities, then we would have been going the opposite direction for the last several years, right, in the sense of we actually have fewer offices now for wealth management than we did 5 years ago, 10 years ago. And that's because that engagement at the higher level often happens at the client's office, at the client's home. \n",

So it's a multifaceted engagement model. And one that, again, we think we can differentiate ourselves in this. Jason talked about some of the calling statistics. If you talk to our partners in wealth management, as we said, they've been more engaged over this time period than the 3 months, let's say, prior to it. A lot of that because of all the activity, but also they've used different ways to do it.

Once those season and are here, it enables us to extend more and invest those more, whether it's in loans or non-high-quality liquid assets. And that creates a lot of value for us. \n",

We've also invested more heavily in infrastructure there. But at the same time, that's where there are some capital IT projects that we might not do. \n",

So -- and when you look at, in general, how much they make up of the category, it's actually a fairly small percentage. It's just that they can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter.

I think, but in the longer run, this base of business is based on deposits that's more core, we'll be able to invest in a better way. The counter to that is that the duration that we built in the portfolio will start to dissipate. And so the more we're reinvesting of the portfolio that we had coming into this year, the more we're going to experience the impact of lower nominal rates. \n",

Again, there's month-lag and quarter-lag fees, there are more month lag than quarter lag. And actually, the EAFE local was slightly negative on a month-lag sequential basis. So there was a little bit of market pickup, but there was, also to Jason's point earlier, about the 1% sequential kind of organic 1-ish percent organic growth. \n",

So with custody and fund administration, first, and this is in C&IS, there's about 35% to 40%, call it, 40% of fees that are not asset-value sensitive. So that's the first part. Of the fees that are asset value sensitive, so the remaining 60%, about 3/4 of those are a month lag and 1/4 of them are quarter lag, which is similar to what we've -- what we would have updated a year ago. \n",

And then remember, as far as the asset sensitive, it's not all equity exposure because we have an allocation across multiple asset classes. When you get to the Wealth Management side, I would probably divide it between the regions and the global family office. The global family office business, you're right. There is a -- that is probably more leaned toward the quarter lag. It's similar to the asset servicing business and C&IS. And there's also about 1/4 of those fees that aren't asset-sensitive, more like what you see on the asset servicing side of C&IS. \n",

And it's a matter of transitioning that business on. And one of the things that, again, I want to give credit to our team on, is the fact that even in the month of March, with everything that happened, we were able to transition the majority of the business that was scheduled to be transitioned.

And so they've said, \"Let's move our transition back further.\" So they're deferred transitions.

Are they more in a spending mode, if you will, utilizing mode, if they're a sovereign wealth fund, that's being impacted by the environment? Or if they're an asset manager, are they a part of the market that is a net gainer of flows or a net outflow? And that, of course, then will impact us as well. \n",

So in that sense, I would say, we feel very good about the process around capital management and how we think about capital actions and the stress testing that we do, et cetera.

Are there any of those outside situations today that we just wouldn't expect Northern to have a credit exposure? I'm not asking for specific names, but just to XYZ companies like, \"Wow, how did that happen?\" is there any of that on the books today versus what it was in '01? \n",

      "Well, I appreciate the historical perspective on that going back to 2001. And I would say as far as the nature of how we think about credit, it's still very similar. I mean it's aligned with our overall business and with holistic relationships. So that has not changed. And specifically to clients where we are the custodian for their pension plans, we often then are participating in their credit facilities. \n",

And so it's a very high-quality set of companies as well and high-quality set of credits. There's no way that we can necessarily predict which sectors are going to be impacted by a particular stress scenario. And so we wouldn't make the type of statement to say and we have no exposures to any sectors that are troubled right now. Certainly, we do. But all of that, we try to manage the size of the exposures for that. And that's just -- you've just identified one area, which is on the corporate side. Certainly, we work with asset managers. \n",

And so that can either be the companies that are owned by families, but also the individual credit needs. As Mark mentioned, about 20% of our portfolio overall is basically margin lending. It's collateralized by their investment portfolio. And so that would reflect the nature of that credit needs for that part of the client base. \n",

I guess one way that I've kind of talked about, I think even on the last call, we kind of talked about it. Certainly, you have BOLI that has come in incrementally in each of the last 4 quarters, with this quarter being about $13 million. \n",

If you adjust taking BOLI out the last 4 quarters and adjust for the things we've called out, and you kind of did the math, you're probably looking at an average run rate of, call it, $33 million, $34 million. And then in theory, you could then say, \"Okay, well, let me add the full run rate of BOLI in and add $13 million to that.\" So maybe that gets you to the $45 million, $47 million range. \n",

We've talked about some of the things that this quarter, some of the marks might flow through that line. The Visa-related income-expense type of swap marks flow through that line as well.
