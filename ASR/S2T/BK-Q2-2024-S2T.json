{"text": " Good morning and welcome to the 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY. At this time, our participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or re-broadcast these materials without BNY's consent. I will now turn the call over to Maryice Mertz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dermott McDonough, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, we will reference our Financial Highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. And I'll note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-gab measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Question about these statements and non-gab measures are available in the Iron Spreds release, financial supplement, and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only out of today, July 12, 2024, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Thanks, Maryice. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before Dermott reviews the financials in greater detail, I'd like to start with a few remarks about our progress in the quarter. In short, we delivered another quarter of improved financial performance, with positive operating leverage on the back of solid fee growth and continued expense discipline. And we continued to make tangible progress on our path to be more for our clients, to run our company better and to power our culture. Last month, we celebrated our company's 240th anniversary with our people and many of our clients. Even with this rich history of operating across four centuries, I believe that our best days remain ahead of us. That bank with around half a million dollars of capital in 1784, today oversees roughly 50 trillion dollars in assets and powers platforms across payment, security settlement, wealth, investments, collateral, trading, and more for clients in over a hundred markets around the world. As the world changes, and global financial markets evolve, so do we. We are this year, in January, you heard us layout our strategy, which maps out what we need to get done and how we need to do it. Last month, we introduced changes to our logo and simplified and modernized our company brand to BNY, to improve the market's familiarity with who we are and what we do. This rebranding better aligns the perception of our company to the substance of what we are doing to unlock our full potential as one BNY. Now referring to page two of the financial highlights presentation, the NY delivered solid EPS growth, as well as free tax margin and ROTCE expansion, once again, on the back of positive operating leverage in the second quarter. The reported earnings per share of $1.52 was up 16% year over year, and excluding notable items, earnings per share of $1.51 was up 9%. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% year over year. This included 5% growth in investment services fees, led by continued strength, influence in collateral management, asset servicing and treasury services, while as 16% growth in foreign exchange revenue. That interest income decreased by 6%. Fences of $3.1 billion was down 1% year over year. Including notable items, expenses were up 1%, reflecting further investments in our people and technology while we also continued to realise greater efficiencies. Arjun was 33%. And in what is seasonally our strongest quarter, we reported a return on tangible common equity of 25%, 24%, excluding notable items. These financial results were against the backdrop of a relatively constructive operating environment. The market calling for a gradual and shallow easing of policy rates, inflation pressures easing and investor confidence growing. On average, equity market values increased, while fixed income markets finished slightly lower compared to the first quarter. A couple of weeks ago, the Federal Reserve released the results of its annual bank stress test, which once again showcased our resilient business model and our strength to support clients through extreme stress scenarios. The test confirmed that our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement remains the regulatory floor of 2.5%. And we increased our quarterly common dividend by 12% to 47 cents per share starting this quarter. In May, the transition to T plus 1 settlement in the US, Canadian and Mexican markets represented one of the more significant market structure changes that our industry has seen in a couple of decades. The NY's critical role in the financial system gives us the opportunity to help clients through major shifts like this further strengthening their trust in us and deepening our relationships with them. By running the company better, we are starting to capitalise on the NY's truly powerful combination of security services, market and wealth services and our investments and wealth businesses to serve our clients more effectively across the entire financial life cycle. As an example, this past quarter, BNY was awarded a significant mandate by a Premier Global Asset Manager with over $100 billion in assets under management. We were selected based on our ability to deliver custody, fund servicing, ETF and digital fund services, treasury services and perjing. Our holistic offering will power their future growth strategy. In another example, AIA, the Pan Asian Life Insurance Group, announced a new collaboration with BNY and BlackRock as AIA transforms its investment platform. AIA has announced that they will implement BNY's specialized investment operations, data management services and technology with BlackRock's Aladdin to create a connected and scalable ecosystem to support the company's evolving investment activities. We also continue to be pleased with the growing interest in our Wealth Advisory Platform Wove. Global Finance recently named Wove as one of the top three global financial innovations as part of its annual innovators awards for 2024. At Insight, Pershing's annual flagship wealth services conference in June, we announced a suite of new solutions on the platform. Wove Investor, a one-shot client portal, Wove Data, a cloud data platform designed for financial professionals at wealth management firms and portfolio solutions, a set of enhancements to the platform that will help advisors move more efficiently from researching investment products, aligning them to a client's risk objectives and adding them to a portfolio. We also introduced a new one-BNY offering that enables clients to easily access multiple BNY capabilities, including our managed accounts platform, asset allocation and manager selection, investment management products, customized tax solutions, the interoperable Wove Platform for advisors and custody and clearing services from Pershing. For a comprehensive, unified package, leveraging the breadth of BNY to make clients' wealth advisors lives easy. And we have proof points. Example, a fast-growing, full-service regional bank recently selected Pershing to provide custody and clearing services, private wealth business. But they are also adopting, advisory, driver's cash management, direct indexing and private banking. As we've said many times, our culture and people are a critical part of being more for our clients and running our company better. We are pleased to see that our actions are enabling us to be a top talent destination for recent graduates and experienced leaders alike. This summer, we're welcoming our largest ever intern and analyst classes, a total of over 3,500 individuals chosen from over 150,000 applications. And we recently announced several new appointments to our leadership team. Shannon Hobbs, our new chief people officer, joined us in June. The Anne Russell will join us in September as chief information officer and global head of engineering. Jose Menaya will also join us in September. Lead, be in wise, investments and wealth. To wrap up, halfway through the year, we're pleased with the progress that we have made and how it is reflected in both improved financial performance to date as well as our building momentum. One of my favorite quotes comes from Alexander Hamilton, our founder, who famously said that he attributed his success not to genius but to hard work. We have been hard at work and we've laid a solid foundation. Our team is in full execution mode and we're starting to demonstrate the power of our franchise and of operating as one BNY for our clients and our shareholders. With that, over to you, Dumb. Thank you, Robin and good morning, everyone. Taking up on page 3 of the presentation, I'll start with our consolidation financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% year over year. V revenue was up 4%. This includes 5% growth in investment services fees on the back of higher market values, net new business and higher client activity. Investment management and performance fees were flat. Burmwydaea, a 49.5 trillion, were up 6% year over year and assets under management of 2 trillion dollars were up 7% year over year, primarily reflecting higher market values. Bar and exchange revenue increased by 16% driven by higher volumes. Another revenue was $169 million in the quarter on the back of strong client activity in our fixed income and equity trading business. And net interest income decreased by 6% year over year, primarily reflecting changes in balance sheet makes, partially offset by higher interest rates. Expenses were down 1% year over year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items, primarily in the prior year. The increase from higher investments in employee marriage increases and higher revenue relationships expenses was partially offset by efficiency savings from running our company better. Notable items in the second quarter of this year primarily included an expense benefit from a reduction in the FGIC's special assessment, which is largely offset by 7th expense. There was no provision for credit losses in the quarter. As Robin highlighted earlier, we reported earnings per share of $1.52 up 16% year over year, a pre-tax margin of 33%, and a return on tangible common equity of 25%. Excluding those belisings, earnings per share were $1.51 up 9% year over year, pre-tax margin was 33% and a return on tangible common equity was 24%. Turning to capsule and liquidity on page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 5.8%. Average assets increased by 2% sequentially on the back of deposit growth, and Tier 1 capsules increased by 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting capsule generation through earnings, partially offset by capsule returns to common shareholders. Our Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.4%. The quarter over-courtier improvement reflects lower risk-wraited assets coming off the temporary increase in risk-wraited assets at the end of the previous quarter, and Tier 1 capsules increased by 2% sequentially. To the course of the second quarter, we returned over $900 million of capsules to our common shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 81%. Year to date, we returned 107% of earnings to our common shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Turning to liquidity. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 115%, and our consolidated net-sites stable funding ratio was 132%. Next, net interest income and the underlying balance sheet trends on page 5. Net interest income of over $1 billion was down 6% year over year, and down 1% quarter over-courtier. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by changes in balance sheet mix, partially offset by the benefit of reinvesting maturing fixed rate securities in higher yielding alternatives. Average deposit balances increased by 2% sequentially. Interest bearing deposits glued by 3%, and non-interest bearing deposits declined by 2% in the quarter. Average interest-earning assets were up 2% quarter over quarter. Our average investment security portfolio balances increased by 3%, and our cash and reverse repo balances increased by 1%. Our cash loan balances were up 4%. Turning to our business segments starting on page 6. Security services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion flat year over year. Total investment services fees were up 3% year over year. In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 4%, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business. We continue to see strong momentum in ETF servicing with AUCA of over $2 trillion up more than 50% year on year, and the number of funds serviced up over 20% year on year. Disc growth reflects both higher market values as well as client-inflows, which included a large ETF mandate in Ireland from a leading global asset manager. In alternatives, fund launches for the quarter continue their recent activity in private markets. The services fees for alternatives were up mid-single digits reflecting growth from both new and existing clients. In initial services, investment services fees were up 1%, reflecting net new business across both corporate trust and depository receipts, partially offset by the normalization of elevated fees, associated with corporate actions into depository receipts in the second quarter of last year. We're particularly pleased to see the investments and new leaders in our corporate trust platform beginning to bear fruit. Against the backdrop of a significant pick-up in CLO assurance in recent months, we've been moving up the ranks and improved our market share as trustee for CLOs by about 4% each point over the past 12 months to 20% in the second quarter. In the segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 16% year over year, and net interest income was down 11%. Expenses of $1.6 billion were down 1% year over year, reflecting efficiency savings, partially offset by higher investments, employee marriage increases, and higher revenue-related expenses. Pretax income was $688 million, a 7% increase year over year, and pretax margin expanded to 31%. Next, marketing wealth services on page 7. Marketing wealth services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 6% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 7% year over year. Inpurging, investment services fees were up 2%, reflecting higher market values and client activity, partially offset by the impact of business loss into prior year. Net new assets were negative $23 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of the before mentioned to us business. Excluding the deconversion, we saw approximately 2% annualized net new asset growth in the second quarter, and we renewed our multi-year agreement with the Ozeig, one of the nation's largest providers of wealth management solutions. Carging has supported Ozeig since its founding in 1988, and we are proud to help the company drive its growth strategy for years to come. Client demand for woe continues to be strong. In the quarter, we signed 12 additional client agreements. The pipeline continues to grow, and we are on track to meet our goal of $30 to $40 million realized revenue in 2024. In clearance and collateral management, investment services fees were up 15%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes. US security clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong throughout the quarter, supported by a grown market and active trading. And we are excited about the opportunity to do even more for clients. Having realigned Pershing's institutional solutions business to clearance and collateral management, we can offer clients a choice across the continuum of clearance, settlement, financing solutions for those that serve clear as well as those seeking capital and operation efficiency throughout sourcing. This allows us to not only deepen our relationships with clients, but also drive continued revenue growth. And in Treasury services, investment services fees increased by 10%, primarily reflecting net new business and higher client activity. Such an interest income for the segment overall was down 1% year over year. Expenses of $833 million were up 5% year over year, reflecting higher investments, employee marriage increases, and higher revenue-related expenses, partially upset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was up 8% year over year at $704 million, representing a 46% free tax margin. Moving on to investment and wealth management on page 8. Investment and wealth management reported total revenue of $821 million, up 1% year over year. In our investment management business, revenue was down 1%, reflecting the mix of AUM flows and lower equity investment income and see capsule gains partially upset by higher market values. And in wealth management, revenue increased by 3%, reflecting higher market values, partially upset by changes in product mix. Expenses of $668 million were down 2% year over year, primarily reflecting our work to drive efficiency savings and lower revenue-related expenses, partially upset by employee marriage increases and higher investments. Pre-tax income was $149 million, up 15% year over year, representing a pre-tax margin of 18%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 7% year over year. In the quarter, while we saw 2 billion of net inflows into long-term active strategies with continued strength in fixed income and LDI, partially upset by net outflows in active equity and multi-ass strategies. We saw $4 billion of net outflows from index strategies and $7 billion of net outflows from short-term strategies. Welfth management kindness of $308 billion increased by 8% year over year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 9 shows the results of the other segments. I'll close with a couple of comments on our outlook for the full year 2024. Starting with NII, I'm pleased to report that the first half of the year came in slightly better than we had expected, as we saw the decline in non-interests bearing deposits desalurate, and we continue to grow interest bearing deposits. While we are cautiously optimistic, we remain humble as we head into the seasonally low summer months, and for now we will therefore keep our NII outlook for the full year 2024 unchanged down 10% year over year. Regarding expenses, our goal remains to keep expenses excluding those belisings for the full year 2024, roughly flat. As Robin put it earlier, BNY is in execution mode, and we're embracing the hard work ahead of us. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be between 23 and 24%. And lastly, we continue to expect to return a hundred percent or more of 2024 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Our board of directors declared our 12% increased common dividends for the third quarter, and we plan to continue repurchasing common shares under our existing share repurchase program. As always, we are calibrating the pace of our buybacks considering various factors such as our capital management targets, the macroeconomic and interest rate environment, as well as the size of our balance sheet. To wrap up, we enter the second half of the year on the back of solid fee growth, a better than expected NII performance to date, and continued expense discipline, which gives us incremental confidence in our ability to drive positive operation leverage in 2024. With that operator, can you please open the line for Q&A? Thank you, and if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. Our first question is coming from Ken Euston with Jeffries. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, Ken. Good morning. Just like to go just asked, Irma, about that NII humbleness for the second half, can you just walk us through what the moving pieces would be, including the seasonality that you mentioned, and any other things that might have been over-earning in the NII in the first quarter, so that you would seemingly in your maintained guide still expect a meaningful ramp down in NII, which I don't think is what seems to be the base case given how well the balance sheet has held up so far as you pointed out relative to your expectations. Thanks. Thanks for the question, Ken. I guess the best way to answer the question is a little bit too, in some ways, look back at last year, where Q1, Q2 typically strong quarters for us, Q3 typically a seasonally lower quarter, summer months, clients, taking their foot off the gas in terms of activity, and then we pick back up again in Q4. Now, as you've seen from this quarter's numbers and the first half overall, we're very pleased with the performance. I guess we've outperformed our expectations for the first half, and that's in large part due to underlying activity within our core businesses, and in my remarks, I particularly called out corporate trust, where we saw like elevators activity in the CLO space, which in turn drives deposits. So when our core businesses are doing well, which they've all performed well, that has a knock-on impact in the number of deposits that we have, and so we outperformed our expectations in the first half, notwithstanding that when I look out at the rest of the year, and when we gave the guidance of down 10% in January, the market at that time was roughly calling for six rate cuts. Now we're in the middle of the summer, we had to slow down in an inflation print yesterday, let's see how Jay speaks on Monday, and how he guides out of Jackson Hole and into a September potential rate cut. But we kind of take all of those levers, and we just kind of say for now, there's no point in me changing guidance to change guidance again in September or October at the next call. So we're cautiously optimistic, I think I used the word last year in March, as Q, so we're playing for the best outcome, but we do expect Q3 to be somewhat seasonally quieter, and that's why we didn't change our guidance. Okay, and then just can you, that follow up just on the size of the deposit, so just you're just expecting the size of the deposit based to decline, or is it the mix, or just trying to understand what pieces of it do, you know, would revert given that seasonality? So when I think about deposits, I kind of, I think there are three components to it, one is interest bearing deposits where we outperformed plan, NIBs where we outperformed plan, and so please with that, but that really reflects clients showing up in a different way with us, and we showing up in a different way with clients, so good. And then the third thing, and I've talked about this a number of times on previous calls, really the strength of the collaboration and teamwork between our Treasurer, our CIO, and our Global Equidity Solutions platform, where we think about liquidity as a 1.4 trillion dollar ecosystem, and we've been very much in offense mode, this quarter, and our GLS team has really shown up in a positive way, and we really managed to gather good liquidity friendly deposits. Which is kind of fueling the growth of our balance sheet, and that's allowed us to do more loans. So I think in terms of specifically to your question, it's both, I think the overall balance will come down, and as a consequence, I would expect NIBs from here to grind a little bit lower, which is the main driver of the NII change. Right, okay, thank you. Our next question is coming from Glenn Shore with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks very much. You alluded to the, hello. You alluded to the higher clearance and collateral management, higher clearance volumes. I'm just curious if you can parse out how much of that is just clients being more active, there are more active second quarter versus winning new business. And organic growth, which just might help for the thought from the Gulf forward and how to model things. Thanks, Glenn. I think it's a combination of both. So clients are for sure doing more rate volatility in Q2 was there for all to see. So as a consequence, more activity in the treasury market, more, more treasury issuance, which feeds volumes. So overall, very healthy volumes, and we have a high margin scaled business, which the platform was able to benefit from that increased level of activity. Also, I think as we did last year, we continue to innovate for clients in the domestic market. And as we said on our January call, the international business is also a key growth opportunity for us. And our teams are innovating and developing new products and solutions for our clients internationally. And so I think it's a combination of all the factors that we've talked about on previous calls, kind of showed up as a nice tailwind for this quarter. And for clearance and collateral management, I think I do expect that trend to continue in the near term. Thanks, Janet. You picked my interest on the opening remarks. You all talked about T plus one coming in into the market and that helping you helping clients. I'm curious now that it's built, now that it's in the run rate, just a couple of quickies of, is there a cost runoff now, or is that not big enough? Does T plus one come with lower spread for you, but does it free up capital with more frequent settlement? I'm just curious what the net impact of it all is. I would describe it in terms of the raw P&L impact, which is sort of the second part of your question, is really pretty de minimus. We spent a bunch of time preparing for this over the course of the past couple of years. So it wasn't like there was some big hump in the cost curve in order to really do it. We sort of worked the process over time. But for us, I think the biggest opportunity associated with T plus one is whenever there's a market inflection like this, and this was one of the more significant ones, but we're looking ahead to Treasury clearing as another good example or something like that, it gives us the opportunity to get closer to our clients. It creates uncertainty for our clients. How is it going to work? And they need help navigating it. And so the combination of uncertainty and a need for assistance is really the macro opportunity for us. And we've lent into that. We'll continue leading into those types of market changes. Again, with Treasury clearing being another good example. And I would say overall, these types of changes create things that create more efficiency in the market, things that can reduce risk in the market, things that improve efficiency. Sure, they do sometimes call on more of our products and solutions, which of course is great, but it's also just a good thing for the market to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of market operation. And I think over time, we're also at beneficiary of that. Okay, great. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Abraham, from the Walla, with Bank of America. Please go ahead. I just want to follow up a document for you on an I. I guess in this quote to Ken's question, he talked about Fed policy and that having an impact. Remind us the positioning of the balance sheet. If the Fed does decide to cut rates come September and we get 150 bits of cuts. Remind us how the balance will behave. How we should think about NII in that bad job. So thanks for the question. So so our kind of I give a couple of different perspectives on that is one in cumulative basis, roughly unchanged quarter over quarter, which feels like I really believe our book to be fairly priced. As you will remember, you know, our book is largely institutional. We pass on the rates and so cumulative basis are in good shape. So for that for the dollar portfolio, roughly low 80s 80 range. And then for euros and dollar euros and starting were in the high 50s low 60s. And so we kind of do a range of scenarios and at the beginning of the year we're positioned roughly we're roughly flat. So if chairman Powell cuts in September and then cuts again, I guess which is the general view of the market, we're kind of basically NII okay. It doesn't really impact the book that much. So for small moves, we're we're well positioned in terms of expectation. Understood and separately, I guess maybe Robin for you just in terms of the fee revenue momentum that you talked about that for sharing. And elsewhere just give us a sense around what the drivers we should be thinking are as we think about for the medium term outlook on fee revenue outside of just pure markets activity that could drive fees in a world where NII. I might be able to lower everything about sort of momentum on the opposite of live. Sure, the revenue growth in any given year is somewhat market dependent because of course interest rates, equity, fixed income markets, volumes, volatility that stuff all moves around. But our strategy has been of course to fuel the organic growth of the company but also to try to position our businesses to be able to respond as well as they can to growth tailwinds that exist just in markets. So in answer to Ken to the question earlier on around the treasury market, we've positioned that business to be able to benefit from what we think is a secular growth in activity in the US treasury market. So that's a place where we're benefiting yes from the market we're also benefiting from the investments that dermate detailed. And as we go through what's next for our fee growth, we talked a lot about our 1BNY campaign quarters ago and we talked last quarter and in January about the fact that we're sort of operationalizing more and more what started off as a movement of 1BNY into referrals, into new targets, into our commercial model and our chief commercial officer joining. And really then getting into the client coverage, the practices, the integrated solutions which we talked about in our prepared remarks, the fact that we can now bundle individual products into true solutions for clients. So there are a lot of levers on the fee growth and we've been working very methodically through our plan to build momentum in that space but also to position the business to be able to take advantage of macro things going on in the market. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Chulok with Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Good morning, Robin. Good morning, Dermott. Good morning, Steven. So I guess I wanted to build on that earlier line of questioning but really focusing more on repo activity. It's been a big area of investor focus. You've certainly benefited from recent strengths on the repo side and I was hoping you could potentially quantify the benefit year on year from elevated repo activity and just a longer term like how you're thinking about the durability of the recent repo strength and what are some of the factors supporting that view. Thanks for the question, Steven. So I would say in terms of year on year activity, it's not a kind of a cleared repo. It's not a game changer for us in terms of the overall year on year NII story. It's about overall in its totality. It makes up about 5% of our NII today. I think I would just echo our follow on from Robin's answer to the last question in terms of it's a product. Clients wanted we are meeting them where they want to be. We're innovating. This comes under the 1.4 trillion dollar liquidity ecosystem. Lide runs that business does a terrific job for us in the cleared repo business specifically. We're a top three provider. We have a large installs client base who are looking for products and we can meet them with our cleared repo product. It's just another tool in our toolbox and I would say again we're positioned. We're investing. We're a scale player and we can provide automated solutions for our clients. So I do expect that business to continue to grow but in terms of the year over year to your specific question, it's not a material driver of the year over year change. Steven, I would add one thing to it which is just remember that in the context of our business we're really the only global solution provider in the space because we're scaled in Asia, we're scaled in Europe, we're scaled in the United States. And in a world where folks are looking at repo is a collateral tool and an investment tool. The opportunity to be able to help clients navigate the whole world in this product provide the seamless connectivity between repo and margin and collateral management, the connectivity to other things that we do. There's a real appeal to use Dermott's phrase again about meeting clients where they are. There's a real appeal here for clients in terms of the breadth of what we can offer but also the innovation that he referred to earlier on in the call where we're creating these new solutions. And so this is another example along with the US Treasury market but there are so many others in our business of saying there's a macro evolution going on and we have the opportunity to participate in that as long as we're front footed with clients and as long as we're innovating. Thanks for all that color and just for my follow up on the Pershing business I know that the core underlying strength has been obscured to some degree by some large client departures. So we can give some perspective on what some of the core organic growth trends look like in that business. What the pipeline looks like in that business given some of the recent excitement around the world platform and the offering and have we lot those headwinds at this point or is there still some remaining pressure on the common. Okay so I would say nobody is happier to see the ongoing de-conversion of the clients you know to come to an end. So we expect that to be fully out of the portfolio by Q3. As I've said I'm pretty just cause we believe in our ability to earn our way through that de-conversion. It happens in life and so I think the team has been very resilient in terms of earning their way through it and growing. In my prepared remarks I talked about the resign of Ozec on a several year contract so we're very pleased about that. You take a step back and you look at where we were 12 months ago we just came off the inside conference in Florida where we announced 12 years late 12 months later we've announced a new suite of products to support the wall. We have signed 21 clients so far this year for WOLF. The momentum is building the clients like us. I reiterated my guidance on the prepared remarks about the 30 to 40 million dollars of revenue for this year. And then just I remind you that we're a three trillion dollar player in the wealth tech space. Number one with broker dealers top three with OIAs and you know in previous quarters I've kind of guided you know mid single digits of underlying core growth through the cycle we continue to believe that notwithstanding on any given quarter it may be slower or better but we believe we're in good shape. And there's good momentum in what is a very very large market and in which we're a very big player. Very helpful color thanks so much for taking my questions. Thanks. Our next question is coming from Brennan. How can with UBS your line is open please go ahead. Good morning Robin and Dermott thanks for taking my questions. So we saw the ECB cut rates this quarter and while I know Euro isn't a huge exposure for you in terms of your deposit base curious about what impact you saw that on your deposit costs in that currency and maybe how does that experience. And then you can see the reaction in form your expectations for beta and customer behavior around rate cuts in other currencies. Thanks. So I would say overall euros is roughly 10% the total total portfolio. So I think we're really a question I think we're we feel very well positioned for you know the range of outcomes that the forward curve is implying in euros sterling and dollars. We prepare for us. We talk about it a lot. And so I kind of feel like the way the CIO book is currently set up where we still have a reasonable amount of securities rolling off into higher yielding assets. So I just feel like the combination of where our deposit book is in terms of our beta to reiterate again for dollars low 80s sterling in euros high 60s. And the CIO book kind of still room to grow. And so on rate cuts in terms of how we kind of position the book were broadly symmetric in terms of on the rate cut side. So we I think you know chairman Powell has done a good job of telegraphing to the market how he wants to to do it. So I don't think it's going to be a volatile move and rates when it happens. So he's allowed us time to position and manage and get into the right place. So I think overall I feel very good about where we're at. Yeah, but what I was asking I appreciate that what I was trying to understand was the actual experience with in the actual marketplace beyond like the expectation. Did the 50 to 60% beta I think you said in euros did that hold when the cut went through and did you actually experience that. So specifically yes we did experience that and it held up it behaves as a correct. Excellent thank you thank you for that. I appreciate that. I'm a issuer services very solid you flagged you know some COO trust e gains on the back of a market that seems solid volume could you help us understand maybe how much of the strength and the growth that you saw in that line was attributed to that which I assume would be in the corporate trust business you know and then and then maybe how to think about the cost or your seats fees just so we're thinking about the right way to baseline and move forward on models. So sure look corporate corporate trust I think is for us a good opportunity a very good opportunity I actually talked about it at some length at the or B.C. conference in March. When I was chatting with your capacity and I think over the last number of years corporate trust for B.M.Y. is in the business that's been under invested in in both in both technology and leadership and in both Robin and I prepared remarks we did emphasize leadership as being a continuous change for us. And we've made it very a couple of very important hires over the last 12 months in corporate trust and we have new leadership overseen overseen the business and it's that investment and in technology products leadership that is showing up and specifically you know we've doubled our activity and CLOs over the last 12 months we've improved our market share. And as Robin said a couple in an answer to another question we really want to position corporate trust as a business that really can take the advantage of off scale a lot of manual processes a lot of room for AI a lot of room for digitization and we can improve the operating leverage of that business we can improve how we show up for clients clients service. So we feel like in corporate trust specifically we have a lot to play for depository receipts we have good market share we punch above our ways and we expect that to continue. Thank you for taking my questions. Our next question is coming from Betsy Gray-Six with Morgan Stanley please go ahead. Hi good morning. Morning Betsy. Two quick questions one just to wrap up a little bit on the T plus one discussion earlier. Could you give us a sense of how much did T plus one drive sequential revenue growth is quarter and can you give us a sense as to if there's enough revenue growth you're expecting from this to impact the expense ratio since you've already made the investments and then I have a follow up on what thanks. Hi Betsy it's Dermott so the point I would make about T plus one is not so much a revenue or expense topic it really is it speaks to resilience as a commercial attribute. Kind of point that we make on behalf of B and Y in terms of it's been a large scale infrastructure change that's been coming to the markets over the last couple of years. And as we're a key player in the financial market infrastructure it's very important that we execute that to an A plus standard. And what I would say is B and Y has shown up for clients in delivering an A plus execution of a very big project it's not it's not really about revenue or expenses it's really about delivering a complicated change project for our clients and the and the ecosystem at large that's really I think the point we're trying to make on T plus one. Okay yeah I just think if you're in a better spot than others you could pick up some incremental share on the back of that but that's maybe a couple of conference calls from here all right then separately on woes. I know you mentioned that you added new clients to woe I just wanted to understand is this new clients of the firm or this is clients who had been yours for a while and they moved to woe. So I would say it's both and so I guess the questions that we've had on previous calls that are we cannibalizing existing clients and the answer to that is most definitely no and I think it speaks to the point of us innovating you know woe was a very big investment for us in terms of technology over multiple years existing clients like the fact that we're willing to do that. So the fact that we're willing to put money to work for them and give them better solutions and as a consequence of that you know we had over 1,500 people show up to woe in Florida last year in Nashville this year and for those that are there there's real excitement and as Robin said in his prepared remarks it's winning awards. So there's a flight wheel effect of oh wow B and Y is showing up in the wealth tech space and delivering new solutions for us we want to see what they have to do so the network effect of that shouldn't be underestimated. Betsy let me double click on it for one second as well because when we started on the Woe journey and we announced it as Dermott said last year it was initially really focused on what that singular KPI of making advisors lives easier and so it was a technology front end that went from wealth planning and help clients with wealth planning all the way through to portfolio construction and then getting into market. Now what's evolved since then and what we talked a lot about this year one year later in the Woe journey was the fact that now we have the opportunity to link all of these other B and Y capabilities to be able to deliver to our Pershing and Woe clients so you can be a clearing and custody client of Pershing you can be an advisor taking advantage of that initial set of tooling from Woe but what you can now also do is you can have that ability to manage and aggregate data including across multiple custodians we can connect you to models in the investment management space by the way we can fulfill those models because we've got active equity and indexing and we can have an indexing and all these capabilities that come from B and Y investments and so Woe is becoming a bit more of a delivery vehicle for the various capabilities of the firm and it's also opening up the aperture of how clients of Pershing think about us in terms of our ability to solve other problems for them banking as a service which is a treasury services business but we stimulate the conversation for that because people see us as being more than what we used to be in Pershing we also to your question are attracting people who don't necessarily need the clearing and custody service but who want to take advantage of these other components which is why Dermott said both because it's both and delivering the breadth of one B and Y. Thanks, Robin. Thank you Betsy. Our next question is coming from Mike Mail with Wales Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, could you put a little more meat on the bones for the one B and Y initiative in terms of products for customers where you're talking about more bundled solutions. You know, thematically, you know, I understand it and I guess you're having higher core servicing fees but connecting from the higher core servicing fees from the high level let's bundle let's have everyone work together. I'm just trying to connect the dots a little more understood Mike and you know you'd ask me a question is probably about more than a year ago now where you had essentially challenged the fact that in order for something like one B and Y to be successful it can't just be hearts and minds. It's got to be deeply operationalized and we talked at that time about some of our future ambitions for how to really bring it home. So the way that I would now answer your question is we are rallying around the three strategic pillars that Dermott and I both have talked about a bunch and this is about being more for our clients. And that's not just words anymore. It's not just a movement. It's not just appealing to our people to be able to do to do to be client obsessed. It's about elevating the effectiveness of our sales organization and the process driving client service differently than we used to. It's about the innovative new products as we were just talking about woe that's a good example. We are being more for clients in that example and we are also delivering the whole of the company. So it is a great one B and Y example perjing which used to be somewhat off to the side in the company a few years back. Now very much at the heart and benefiting from that integration with all of the other capabilities that we have. And then you hit on a critical word which is solutions because that next journey to use the term that Dermott used earlier on of meeting our clients where they are. It's not just about us selling a bunch of great products and client platforms to our clients. It's about the fact that when we look at the challenges that our clients have they actually need things that cut across multiple parts of our company. And rather than going in disconnected and showing them individually and trying to have them piece it all together we can now show up and we can actually show them these solutions which bring all the componentry together to solve their needs. And both Dermott and I talked a bit about that in our prepared remarks and that's the next level of the maturity of that one B and Y work that we're really doing. That's involving from an initiative and a hearts and minds to making everything that we're doing in our commercial organization. The sales practices, the sales targets, the way that we're bringing people together, the account management process, the client service, the digital delivery of tooling and the way that we're thinking about everything that equips our sales people to be effective, the cross training. We're bringing all of those things together and maturing our commercial model and over time we think there's a lot of value both in the process and in what we're actually delivering to clients. And so when you wrap it all up I mean what wallet share do you have for customer today where was it a few years ago where you hope that to go just in terms of a zip code of expectations. I think some of those metrics as we think about ways in which to show you that story more over time some of those metrics will be in our future. Right now I'm going to point you to two things. There are a whole bunch of inputs I described a bunch of them and I think over the course of the past couple of years we've been trying to really show the key inputs which we think are the leading indicators for performance. And then you have to actually look at the fee growth results and you saw that in the first quarter you've seen that in the second quarter and that's some of the output but the story that Dermott and I are both trying to describe is a story of a maturing of a process but with a still a distance to go and opportunity ahead. Mike just to put a metric on us because it's just to give an indication because we need to mature the metrics as we proceduralize all the strategic comments that Robin has just outlined year over year the amount of business that we've won that touches more than one line of business. You know has increased by a third off all be it a very low base. So I wouldn't draw too much into the metric but just the fact that we're showing up in a different way and clients are buying products and services from more than one line of business because we can deliver integrated solutions. And that's the key that over time we'd be able to track that and communicate that in a more objective way as that strategy takes root. Understood so when all said and done core servicing fees over time whether it's a situation or a specific target where should core servicing fee growth be. My answer to that which I recognize is a little bit unsatisfying is we're going to keep pointing you back to the positive operating leverage which is really how we're focusing for our own growth. We think that each quarter each year has a different composition to it but higher fee growth over time is a very important part of that combination of solutions but but any individual quarter or year is going to have a different composition. We're controlling the things that we can control or be it we're stoking the engine for growth of organic fees over time. Got it thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Blosting with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hey good morning things is cruising me in on this. I wanted to touch on expenses and an operating leverage so expenses up a little bit year to date, year to year sounds like you guys are still targeting flat expenses for the for the year despite the fact that revenues are always shaking out a little bit better than you hope so maybe kind of walk us through where you see the flex in the expense base to keep it kind of that flatish run rate but I guess more importantly, you know you guys had a target for pretext margin to be at 33% plus recently. You're doing 33% this quarter and now you don't want to get to care the way with a single quarter but feels like you you know having the ability to reset the bar so maybe talk a little bit about what that plus within the 33 could look like a couple of years out. Thanks Alex so I guess I would start with the margin part of this we need to we need to consistently do us and so one quarter doesn't a medium term target make so I'm very pleased that we've done this but now I want to see it next quarter the following quarter the following quarter so you know execution is key and just showing up in a very disciplined way every day is really important to deliver. We don't want to be known as a one hit wonder so while I'm pleased that we've managed to do it I want to see it repeat is on a consistent basis so that's what I would say on margin on expenses you and I talked in Madrid a few weeks back at your conference and I kind of said a little bit like we're in the zip code of flat for the year. It's all about running the company better it's very important that we have 53,000 people wrapped around the same aspiration that we as a leadership team have and everybody's focused on doing it so it there is a real momentum on running the company better which is the input to how we show up with expenses where being where they are as opposed to a top down approach so very different cultural experience within the firm in terms of how we're doing it. And the reason why we're a little bit above trend in the first couple of quarters this year is what I said to you at the conferences revenue related expenses and so I kind of anchor that in overall where we are for positive operation leverage in the year and in my remarks I kind of said I feel optimistic about delivering positive operating leverage for the year which in a in a down 10% and I I environment BNY hasn't really executed to that level. So I feel good about expenses I feel good about the flat notwithstanding there's pressure to that from a revenue related expense part but we're very determined to deliver positive operation leverage to our shareholders this year. Great well my second quick question around the balance sheet there's a lot of discussion around the positive but I wanted to zone in on the assets out of the balance sheet for a second we've seen pretty nice growth from you guys and both the securities portfolio and loans sequentially so could you spend a minute on sort of the sources where you're investing and then your outlook and maybe deploying some of the liquidity that seems to be perhaps a bit more sticky into both long growth and securities. So yeah look very feel very proud of the CIO book team what they've accomplished over the last couple of years which is really from Q3 of of 22 really has been just a terrific collaboration within the firm and we're deploying where we think we can see opportunity our CIO. We're going to use like to use the word nibbling and so we're kind of seeing where the next leg is and we're deploying where we think we can see opportunity to continue to grow NII so it's opportunistic at the moment but we feel overall very good about that aspect of us we're still rolling off the book into higher yielding securities we're picking up the 200 basis points and so that's feeding NII and then on loan growth. I think the GLS team is doing a really good job of getting very liquidity friendly deposits which allows us to extend credit to our clients and I think we're showing up in a different way to our clients who are important to us and extending our balance sheet to them as they look to buy products in more than one line of business. So where we need the balance sheet to support business activities that's what we're doing and it's a strategic tool in our kit for doing that. Awesome thanks very much. Our next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy with RBC please go ahead. Good morning, Dermin, good morning, Rubin. Good morning Gerard. Dermin can you share with us now that we're entering into a phase with monetary policy of quantitative tightening easing up a bit. You guys obviously have been through QE you've seen the initial stages of QT. Do you have any thoughts on how this could affect your balance sheet over the next 12 to 18 months have you guys done any type of modeling to see what kind of effect. You know the QT is the strings could have on your balance sheet. So we do a lot of work on that Gerard and look you know C car forces us or you know to do that work as well. And so rates up rates down quantitative tightening quantitative easing we look at every which way to Sunday. But the thing that I would kind of remind you and everybody who's listening in is you know our balance sheet is one of our strengths in you know this time last year and Q one of last year we kind of you know we called our balance sheet of the port in the storm for our clients and you see that slight quality so we're kind of very proud of our balance sheet. It's vanilla it's liquid it's it's stand stress tests and it allows us to be there for our clients so it's kind of it's short in duration. We repositioned it going into the higher for longer raise environments as you will remember in Q4 of 22 we repositioned it and so we've taken a lot of proactive steps to make our balance sheet durable and liquid and to withstand. A wide range of scenarios and you're right I'm just going to add that you know it's easy to think that just because it is very moment in time you know we're looking out there seems to be some greater consensus than we've had for a little while around what what might happen with the Fed in the fall across September in the balance of the year. It's easy to think somehow that the range of risks are somehow narrowed as a result of that but there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world we've got a bunch of other types of geopolitical risks out in the world were sort of continuing to grind through elections that we talked about through the course of the year there are all sorts of other things happening we still got wars going on and so our approach to all of these questions and Dermot really made the point is to be prepared for all the different types of outcomes that are possible and so you can see that we've got a lot of different types of outcomes that are possible and so you can see that we've got a lot of different types of outcomes that are possible and so you can see that we've got a lot of different types of outcomes that are possible and so you can see that we've got a lot of different types of outcomes that are possible and so you can see that we've got a lot of different types of outcomes that are possible and so you can see that we've got a lot of different types of outcomes that are possible and so you can see that we look into our range a lot of EA Board who stands for the mandate of the electorate and who was the only candidate we have to be prepared for and so you just want to review the studio? Why are thereasterLA, are there any rolerael and Maced correct for the Very good. And then just as a follow-up, Robin, you talked about the new business wins in the quarter and you talked about one BNY as well. It appears that you're having success in chipping down or breaking down some of the silos that many organizations always struggle with. Can you share with us some of the tools you're using to break those silos and how I would assume you're not 100% complete breaking them all down. But how far along are you in actually breaking them down? Well the company's been around for 240 years and we've acquired a lot of different businesses and companies over time and so these things do build up over a period of time. But the short answer to your question is we passionately believe as a whole leadership team that the answer to the question is culture. And so I've said before in a slightly pithy way and quoting other people or sort of paraphrasing them if you will, that culture eats strategy for breakfast as it was once famously said by Peter Drucker and we add to that execution eats strategy for lunch. That's just a long way of saying that the power our culture teller, which is one of our three pillars, is the thing that's enabling us to run our company better. And that in turn is allowing us to be more for our clients. And so the trick to this for us has been investing in our people. It's been creating the benefits, the experiences, the employee experience, the pride association with the company, the feedback loop that shows that when we do these things we get better outcomes for our clients and that translates into better outcomes in the bottom line. And so there's a flywheel effect here that actually builds on itself. And the spring in the step of our employees is now powering that forward and that's what gives us confidence that we've really turned the corner on it. People want to throw in with the whole because they see that it's not only better for the company, it's actually better for their business because joining their products with other products around the company is allowing us to be more for clients. And it actually feels good to see the benefits in the ultimate results. So that's for us the North Star of how we're doing it. And while we've certainly got a distance to go, the early results have been pretty encouraging. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Badeal with Delshire Bank. Please go ahead. Oh, great. Thanks. Thanks, Morning. Maybe if I could just come back to the sticking with the NII, I got it down 10% and I'm having trouble getting there. Just to confirm, it sounds, like what you're saying is it's really almost totally a deposit driven guide on a seasonal basis. And I just wanted to sort of confirm that given how you've outlined the balance sheet sensitivity to different rates scenarios is pretty strong. And of course, you have the benefit of securities, portfolio reinvestment. So is it really simply just the seasonal deposit dynamic? And then if you can just talk about how NIVs factor into that seasonal deposit dynamic? And then of course, as we move into next year in one queue, seasonally, of course, that should be back positive again. And I just want to confirm that. So I guess, Brian, in the way you've asked the question in some ways, you've answered the question to yourself. So I was kind of confirmed, A, how you're thinking about us in terms of the seasonal decline. And it is a deposit story. And I would just kind of reference last year as the guide in terms of, in January of last year, we guided 20% for the year. And then we started out the gates well. And you as a collective put pressure on me to change the guidance which I didn't do. And we ended the year at 24%. And so last year we used the word skewed to the upside, but humble about the fact of what lies in front of us. And I would say the percentages are different this year. The environment is different, but the sentiment is the same. I'm humble about what the outcome could be. And uncertainty is there because, as Robin said, for sure, what we think is going to happen is not going to happen. But I would say, you know, we're cautiously optimistic. And your point is, it is a deposit story. And within the deposit story, it really is the mix between NIVs and IBs. Right. Okay. Yep. Fair enough there. And then maybe just back to the operating leverage dynamic. And this can be for both German and Robin. The obviously you're starting off really well with, you know, like 100 basis points plus the positive operating leverage as we move into the second half, not withstanding market movements that would obviously influence the C-revenue dynamic. But given the traction that you're showing sequentially in your core business growth and core business sales, and I guess the fact that you've made these investments already. So I just wanted to get a sense of whether you feel like you're able to scale those investments in the second half. And, you know, obviously with Europe's flat operating expense guidance, it would see in that's the case. If the revenue does turn out to be better than expected from a organic growth perspective, would we see the expense base creep up a little bit, you're notwithstanding, of course, you still generate positive leverage. Okay, a lot of questions in that second question. So I would say like when I talk to the teams, right, and this is quite, you're kind of hitting on a very important point in that I really focus on running the company better and then we kind of focus on the operating leverage, not expense as a means to an end. And if revenue-related expenses creep up that we starve businesses of investment to solve for a flat number because that's what we said we were going to do, I think that's quite important. And it's important to get the balance right that investment and running the company better. It kind of is the same thing. And so that's a cultural transformation that's underway with all of our people. And so we really are focused on getting value for money. We spend a lot of money, we spend over 12 and a half billion dollars every year. And so we want to get the best value we can for that and we do that in a number of different ways. So some of the investments that we've made over the last couple of years, we're beginning to see the scale impact in that. And you can see that in our most profitable segments, markets and wealth services, it's a mid-forties margin. We continue to invest at the margin, which is what you want to see from us. And we continue to digitize, we continue to automate, we continue to reduce manual process, which ultimately will feed into headcount and better quality jobs for our folks and better careers. So I think over time, if organic growth plays out, it will feed into a better outcome in operating leverage, not us just growing expenses because revenues are better. And I just want to draw out one additional thing that Dermott said as well, Brian, which is we have a lot of work to do. There's no question about it. And you know, he used the term skew and slightly optimistic, but staying humble when it related to NII. This one is just about a lot of hard work. And really focusing on this point about running the company better. But as a double click into the way that we're thinking about it, if you look at the second quarter, and we've talked a lot about the fact that it's been a seasonally strong quarter, but if you double click into it and the market and wealth services point, the Dermot just mentioned, that's an investment story because as we've said, we're in a good spot on the pre-tax margin of that segment. So we just want more. That's growth. We don't want to dilute the margin, but we're not trying to save expense dollars there. But in security services and in investments and wealth, where we said there is in fact a margin journey that we have ahead of us, that's where you can actually see negative expenses in both of those segments for the quarter, which is a sign of the fact that we're both investing, but we're doing even more discipline in those businesses. And so that's how the whole thing comes together for the company. Great. That's great color. Thank you so much. And our final question is coming from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Yeah, there was some progress on the investment and wealth management margin in the quarter. I guess my quick question is, are your margins different on the asset management side of the business versus the wealth management side? And do you have a timeline for getting back to that 25% plus margin? So I don't think we kind of get into the detail of the split between the two. And so the segment overall, I guess we've said over the last several quarters, we believe we can go back to the 25% margin over a period of a few years. And just to follow on from Robin's answer to the last question, we've shown, I think good expense discipline over the last 12 months in terms of, okay, revenues have been a little bit challenged in the segment due to a variety of reasons. And we've taken tough decisions. And so that's allowed us to grow the margin by 200 basis points over the last year, which really is kind of the financial discipline that bows. And we do believe where we are now with distribution as a platform, you know, very, very strong performance in fixed income and LDI and insight that the momentum is there within the segment to grow. And Robin said the addition of Jose to the leadership team joining in September, giving his fresh perspective gives us confidence about what we can do in the future. Got it. Thanks. Thanks for your time. This concludes today's question and answer session. Right this time I will turn the conference back to Robin for additional or closing remarks. Thank you operator. And thanks everyone for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest in BNY. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well and enjoy the balance of the summer. Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 2pm Eastern Standard Time today.
