11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"I appreciate all the numbers you helped us with and maybe try to peek a little bit more under the covers. So deposits stable. I heard your thoughts on 1Q NII on the further deposit pricing pressure. So the question is, as we go throughout the year, do you have any window into that stability and deposits sticking around? And then with the combination of 75% floating rate loan book and still pressure on deposits, is it reasonable to assume that NII might go down in second quarter forward before stabilizing later in the year and rising. I know that's a little bit further look into the future but ...",negative,0.1318,0.6377,0.2305
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. But it's -- I think it's a very reasonable way to frame looking out farther end of the year. And you're right, for us to say full year numbers at this point, it's just too early. But it is good to think about how the assets and liabilities are going to react with looming rate cuts. And I think it's helpful to think back on how the impact to NIM occurred with rates rising initially was very different than what happened eventually when betas were much higher. And I think on the way down, we might have a similar situation where the first cuts may be different than the later ones. 
And 2 things jump out in my mind. One is, we have never tried to be a price setter in deposits. Our goal has always been keep the deposits in the house and we were very aggressive at following what we saw market pricing was. And the second thing is that as we get these initial cuts, we could see the market reacting in a way to keep deposit cost, deposit yields for clients higher to hold on to deposits. And so I think initially might be tougher than what happens eventually. 
Now all that said, the volumes matter a lot. And it's obviously been extremely hard for us to predict where volumes were going to go. And we saw October better than we anticipated. November was better than October. December was better than November. And so volumes are going to be critical in what happens in the first half of the year and it's just super hard to predict.",neutral,0.1778,0.1737,0.6485
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"I definitely appreciate that. This one might be a little bit easier to follow up, on fee operating leverage. I mean, just by means of pricing alone or the markets alone, the markets had a strong end to the fourth quarter. So your fee run rate should probably be a lot better going into the first quarter. And with your comments on even more sharper discipline on expenses, do you expect to make some meaningful progress early on in the year in this fee-to-expense ratio?",positive,0.9317,0.016,0.0524
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes, you're right to call out that there is a lift, the launch point is higher coming into the year. And I don't know if I'd say meaningful but it's definitely higher. And the lag effects will help us as we walk into the year. And so that's the math of it. But then more strategically, we do feel positive about the pipeline in both asset servicing and in wealth management. And underneath both businesses, our Asset Management business is incredibly important. And as Mike mentioned in his commentary, there's some early signs of flows back in and we always think, just as we do in deposits, just keep the money in the house, keep the client assets in the house. But if our Asset Management business does better, then that helps as well. And so I think the strategic component is also -- we're feeling early signs of some positive movement from an organic perspective.",positive,0.7394,0.0152,0.2455

27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"So I was hoping to maybe just unpack like the deposit discussion a bit further. And specifically, just get a sense as to how you're thinking through the impact of ongoing Fed QT. It does feel like a lot of the liquidity in the system has come out of RRP, that's provided a bit of stability or at least has helped drive better deposit resiliency over the last 6 months. But with the RRP expected to be exhausted over the next, call it, 3 to 4 months, just wanted to get a sense, once that happens, how you expect deposit flows to ultimately trend?",neutral,0.2955,0.0291,0.6754
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes, I'll start and Mike may have thoughts too because we talk about this a lot and it's more predictive than it is quantitatively spitting out results, frankly. But you're right that -- my sense is that the RRP program had a really significant impact on deposits. And it was effectively competing with banks for deposits. And now that it's come down, I do think that, that's been a help. 
Now from here is different. And I think -- we have to think about the fact that rate movements are going to also have an impact on how clients think about deposits. And with the deposit costs having gone up so much in the second half of the year and again, that had a big impact on deposit costs and client behavior, we could see that having an impact this year as rates come down. And so I think it's not just the RRP program but how clients think about instead of 5% rates, how they think about 3% rates and comparing that to maybe more of a risk on trade. And so I think we've got to think both about the program and the rate environment.",neutral,0.1944,0.1537,0.6519
42,Michael Gerard Oâ€™Grady,,"I would agree with what Jason said there. And just as there was a transition on the way up with QE there's going to be a transition on the way down. Unchartered territory for everyone on QT and how they go about that and when they might stop more aggressively seeing their portfolio come down. So I think the timing of that will matter. And then also, we saw with client behavior that as rates went up, more of the liquidity moved into treasuries.  And that had an impact on us. And as we come down, I think, over time, a lot of the funds that have moved into treasuries, will start to move into other alternatives. And as Jason said, our objective is to work with the clients and really try to meet any of those needs and keep the dollars in the house.",neutral,0.144,0.0618,0.7942
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"That's great. And just for my follow-up, the duration on the asset side of the balance sheet admittedly has been a little bit more volatile, especially given some of the repositioning actions you talked about, the asset betas with rate hikes were quite elevated for you guys and some of your trust peers as well. Just wanted to get a sense as to what percentage of the asset side of the balance sheet, if we took a snapshot today, is sensitive to movement in short rates as we do prepare for eventual rate cuts?",neutral,0.1459,0.0791,0.775
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"We can  do it in 3 buckets. And if you just take cash, obviously, 100% of that; the second, loans in roughly 3 quarters are rate sensitive. And you think about the securities portfolio and I'll give you 2 numbers to play with. One is, the duration is meaningful, it now about 1.8%. But also just the weighted average maturity of the portfolio, I think, is also helpful, which is a little under 4 years.  And we quote this balance -- the duration of the balance sheet, that's just us doing a weighted average across those effectively, just to give a sense of the impact of the large size of the cash component and the large floating component of the loan book.",neutral,0.0645,0.0259,0.9096

4,Alexander Blostein,,"Just building on Steven's questions for a second. I guess given the fact that rates are expected to come down and you guys have actually been, I guess, shifting the balance sheet to be maybe a little bit more floating for the right reason and obviously been a good trade for NII for last quarter, this quarter. Any expectations to actually start locking in higher yields going forward and maybe extending duration a little bit. I know this is pretty quick, you guys have just kind of gone the other way but the balance sheet effectively became a little more floating as rates are about to come down. So just curious how you're thinking about that.",neutral,0.1716,0.0768,0.7516
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes, it's on our mind a lot and as we're talking about it and we have brought the duration down. And one of the benefit to that is that it does make it just a lot more flexible because the markets have been really dynamic. And so there will come a time when -- I anticipate where we would say it's time to step out a little bit, our bias over the last year has obviously been to go shorter and that's played out. I think rates -- in the way rates have played out, we had a view and not materially but it worked in our favor. But from here, I think we do have to think about -- it's not locking in as much as just taking the downside risk off the table of a dramatic reduction in rates. And so there's some component there that we'd say we can naturally hedge against.",neutral,0.2618,0.0856,0.6526
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got you. Makes sense. I wanted to follow up for my second one just around the expense outlook. '23 was super noisy. There's a bunch of one-timers, obviously. So I just want to clarify a couple of things. So I guess the ultimate message is that 2024 expense growth is expected to be lower than 2023. I think the core expense growth in '23 was about 5%. So I just want to confirm that. And then the core base you're speaking to, is it still kind of $5.1 billion to maybe $5.2 billion in sort of core expense base of which we should think about '24?",negative,0.0371,0.6035,0.3593
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"So confirm the '23 number we think of is 5%, just a little bit less than that, right at about 4.8%. And we are working from a base in '23 of 5.1%. And probably worthwhile to invest a minute and just explain because you're right, there have been a few things. So if you lock the reported  [ $5.284 billion  ] and then you take out in the year severance-related charges, with 2 occupancy charges that totaled about [ $13 million], there was a client capability write-off, we mentioned in second quarter, $26 million; FDIC special assessment, $85 million. And then there was a small equipment credit of $4 million in the third quarter that was mentioned as well. And the severance-related charge in Q2 was $39 million, just to make sure I give you the numbers on everything. And so let's work -- that tells us we'd work from a base of 5.1%.",neutral,0.0554,0.2173,0.7272

6,Brennan Hawken,,"We'd love to follow up on that last question actually. So thanks for clarifying the base. That's helpful.  #1, just to confirm, you did mention that I think it would be inclusive of adjusting for the write-off of the client capability. Just want to confirm that. And just to clarify the message on the investing, super clear that you're looking to drive expense growth lower than you saw in 2023 but you also laid out an uplift of 3% from base paying software. So does that represent like a floor to growth? Or do you have sufficient levers to offset at least some of that?",neutral,0.3124,0.1835,0.5041
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,It's not a floor but it does give you a sense of what's already in the '24 base from which we're working. And -- so we've got to use productivity to get aggressively at that. Some of our productivity work is already reflected in that but we've got to do more this year. And we wanted to be super transparent in the things that we already know that are in the '24 increase so that you guys can predict what that level is.,neutral,0.1279,0.0199,0.8522

25,Michael C. Brown,,"The sequential increase in the noninterest-bearing deposits, that was a positive to see this quarter. Could you just touch on maybe some of the key drivers there? Was this supported by some of the new business activity that you referenced in the prepared remarks. And then I appreciate the comments on the deposits and the potential for the stability here near term. But I guess, focusing on the NIBs, can they stabilize at this level, either in terms of like an absolute dollar basis or as a percentage of the total deposits?",positive,0.7115,0.0213,0.2672
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"My observation in looking at it is that it's less percentage driven and more what is that base. And the reason I mention it that way is, a lot of that NIB, it comes from one of the channels in our institutional business and it actually performed better than the rest of the institutional business and looking at it over the last few weeks. And so it just tells me that, that client -- that subclient channel behaves on its own. And it looks like that has flattened out somewhat, not necessarily calling it a plateau at this point but it certainly behaved a little bit better than the rest of the institutional book. 
And another component is the wealth book, which -- that deposit base increased in the quarter. It was not dramatically but it was nice to see that up on average. And obviously, we saw, overall the whole deposit book very flat. But nice to see that the wealth book doing well because even though the noninterest-bearing is obviously highly attractive economically, the wealth deposits are very attractive as well, not at zero but they're very attractive. And that component did well in the quarter.",positive,0.7407,0.116,0.1433
25,Michael C. Brown,,"Jason, I guess on the servicing side of the business, I was hoping you could maybe just touch on the competitive landscape and the alternative asset side of the business. How do you think about maybe that opportunity for Northern Trust? And how are your -- if you can just talk about your capabilities today and maybe where you're investing to take some share in that space?",neutral,0.1272,0.0097,0.8631
42,Michael Gerard Oâ€™Grady,,"Yes, Mike. So I'll address that. We believe that the alternative space or broadly speaking, just private markets is a major opportunity for us on the asset servicing side. And that largely follows with what's happening in the marketplace from an investor perspective. And so we expect that market to grow. And we think we have the value proposition that is compelling within that. 
You heard in my comments earlier that we recently won a very large mandate with one of the large private markets firms. And it was after an exhaustive process that we went through to win that business, very capabilities oriented, very global as to the capabilities necessary and the footprint necessary to do it. So again, it's an area of focus for us and one where we think we're going to be able to continue to grow as the market grows and as we're able to take share.",positive,0.8658,0.0075,0.1267

26,Ryan Michael Kenny,,"I have a question on capital. So your CET1 ratio, 11.4%. It's well above the regulatory minimum, well above last year's level. And then we got the comment letter from Basel Endgame a couple of days ago and there's clearly a lot of industry pushback there. Your earnings generation from NII looks a little bit higher than consensus expected. So putting that all together, how should we think about how Northern's approaching buybacks this year, in this quarter. Is there any room to maybe lean in a little bit there?",neutral,0.3994,0.0244,0.5761
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So you're right in the tee up of the numbers. There's obviously room. We did a fair amount of buybacks in the quarter, a little bit more than we do on average. And we're always looking at that relative to other opportunities we have to invest capital. And so in the near term, we're thinking about, does it make more sense to invest in RWA effectively to say we could grow the loan book more. We could do more in FX. We could do more in  sec lending. Or do we want to reposition the -- take a different repositioning in the securities portfolio? 
The repositionings we did this year were all helpful to capital because in going shorter we -- and out of non-HQLA into HQLA on that, we -- those are all helpful to capital. But you also know how closely we look at peers and we take pride in the capital levels we have. We think it's part of our financial model and our business model and talking to clients and being able to evidence to them how strong the capital base is. And so there's definitely room. 
But we also got to have in mind that Basel Endgame, which you referenced briefly, it's still unclear. We did do a comment letter, which you referenced but it's unclear what the impacts are going to be. We think we're in good position relative to peers but I want to keep an eye on that. But we'll also think about additional stock repurchases as we always do, given alternatives we have.",neutral,0.2235,0.0123,0.7642
26,Ryan Michael Kenny,,Okay. Great. And can you also update us on your expectations regarding ability and timing to dispose of the Class B Visa shares? And would that potentially have any impact on capital and buybacks outlook?,neutral,0.0281,0.0305,0.9414
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. So just for people who don't follow it as closely, we own just over 4 million Visa B shares and at the current exchange rate, so that translates to about $1.7 billion. And there's a proposal that it's going to be voted on next week, I think, that would enable the B shareholders to monetize half of the holdings. 
So what are we planning to do? One, at this point, there's nothing to do. The proposal is still outstanding and we've got to wait and see what the shareholder vote looks like. Even assuming it passes, there are timing restrictions to it.  But that said, this is not a strategic asset for Northern Trust. And so you should read into that. It's not something that we're saying we're going to hold on to beyond what the restrictions would enable us to do. And we're discussing all the options. There's likely going to be a combination of a few tools that we'll take but early to give details on that at this point.",neutral,0.0413,0.0374,0.9212
0,Operator,,We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0293,0.0231,0.9476
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"If I could just clarify, Jason, a couple of things you gave guidance on earlier, just to make sure I heard it right. The incremental NII from the 2 portfolio security sales is [ $30 million ] annualized and that comparison period is 1Q versus 4Q. Is that correct?",neutral,0.0467,0.0682,0.8851
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. So you broke up a tiny bit but I think I'm following where you are but don't hesitate to tell me if I miss it. So the November repositioning helped in the quarter by, call it, $6 million. But that should be helpful going forward to the tune of -- in the neighborhood of $15 million a quarter. The January repositioning, which we mentioned for the first time a little while ago, that should help in the quarter about -- round number is about $15 million a quarter.",neutral,0.33,0.0262,0.6438
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"$15 million per quarter. Okay. And then on the expense side, maybe just, again, trying to get some more clarity on the total expense growth. I think you said comp expense being up [ $50 million to $55 million  ] 1Q versus 4Q because of the retirement of eligible options and then employee benefits up $10 million versus 4Q. So correct me if I'm wrong on that. And then just translating that into expense growth through the year. Obviously, there's lots of different levers. But is the idea to try to improve on the 3% expense contribution from that -- from a total growth perspective? Or should we be thinking of expense growth stay better than 5% -- lower than 5% but potentially higher than 3%. And can you improve that trust expense to capacity ratio in '24 from '23?",neutral,0.3362,0.0573,0.6065
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. So, couple of things. One, confirm your numbers are right on first quarter and the step up. Remember, both of those are fully seasonal, Brian, so the step-up in first quarter is just because that's the booking of our retirement eligible equity grants. And so that in and of itself represents the vast majority of that step-up. And then similarly, we've got a higher payroll tax in first quarter just as we hit the caps on that level. But both of those numbers come back down for second, third, fourth quarter. That said, second quarter got to build in the base pay adjustments that we referenced, which is that $65 million, that will be second, third, fourth quarter. 
So all that said, the goal is to do better than the roughly 5% we did this year. The 3% was not seen as the -- again, back to it's not seen as a floor. But also, that's a big difference to go from 5% down to 3%. And so we're using the productivity to do everything we can to get materially better than the 5%. But the fact that we're walking in with 3% already in the base is just going to make it difficult. And so I think it's -- and the last thing I'll mention is, for us, we're anticipating organic growth. That's our -- we target -- we have organic growth targets for each of the 3 businesses. And we want to continue to be a growth company. That is important. And that drives some expenses in addition to expectation of what we're doing from a revenue perspective. And so it's hard to fine-tune much with -- to say is it between 3% and 5%,  if -- we're not doing as well from an organic perspective, we're going to be working really hard to say what else do we do to make sure we're doing the right thing and we get a positive fee operating leverage.",neutral,0.2351,0.0631,0.7018
0,Operator,,We'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,neutral,0.032,0.0253,0.9427
45,James Francis Mitchell,,"Maybe just to follow-up on that last comment, just maybe a little more detail. It seems like organic growth in '23, it was a tough environment, a little mixed. So it seems like you're more optimistic across the board. So if you can kind of just give us a little more thoughts, detail on the organic growth prospects this year?",neutral,0.0767,0.0356,0.8877
42,Michael Gerard Oâ€™Grady,,"Sure, Jim. It's Mike. I'll start off here. So you're absolutely right. We've gone through I would say a time period where the organic growth has definitely been strained and lower than our historical levels. And there's a number of factors behind that, that we've talked about over the preceding earnings calls that relate to client activity, that relate to some of the outflows that we had in the asset management business, which obviously impact then wealth management and asset servicing. And the reason why we're so positive going forward here on organic growth, some of those trends, as we've talked about, have turned around. And so we see good inflows into asset management. So that aspect of it is a lift going forward to our organic growth but then also the strategies that we have in place to drive profitable organic growth. 
Where we've been focused as a company is in a couple of areas, there are few areas. One is really looking at the portfolio of our growth. So historically, asset servicing has been the majority of the organic growth. And looking forward, we're looking to shift that more towards the more scalable parts of our business. So wealth management and asset management. That doesn't mean that the asset servicing business will not be growing. It's just -- we're very focused within that business to the areas that scale the most. 
So if you think about the nature of all the things we do for clients on that front, some of those activities are more scalable, more profitable than others. And so we'll lean towards those areas. I mentioned the success we've had with asset owners in the Americas. A lot of that is the custody and related services on that front. That's some of the more scalable services that we have. And it's, again, not to say that we won't be doing the business with the asset managers, some fund services but some of those areas are more resource intensive. And so we're going to be really disciplined about the types of business that we take in, that require hiring more people, investing more in particular technologies around that. 
And then the last thing I would say just around the organic growth and why we're optimistic on it is, the businesses are working, I would say, much more closely together in how we go to market. So as we would call it here, 1 Northern Trust is our approach to the marketplace. So it's not separate businesses but rather to the extent that we're going to approach a client or a prospect to work with them, it's going to include multiple offerings from across the businesses, particularly asset management with asset servicing, on the front end, as part of a bundle that we're offering to the clients. 
And then certainly with Wealth Management as well. You heard in some of our earlier comments here, the advisory fee component of wealth management has been growing nicely through the year. We think that it can grow at a higher rate. But importantly, the more that we can do on the product side with those clients as well. So as we talk about the transitioning with quantitative tightening, for example and the move out of short-term treasuries to the extent that we can help those clients move into fixed income funds, for example.  That's a real opportunity for us. So a number of things that we're doing to proactively try to drive that organic growth.",neutral,0.1037,0.0692,0.8271
45,James Francis Mitchell,,"That's really great color, Mike. And maybe just a quick follow-up on deposit pricing. Jason, you talked about still some pressure on overall deposit costs. Is that lags still on pricing? Or is that an assumption of a negative mix shift out of NIBs. What's kind of driving further pricing pressure on deposits?",neutral,0.0528,0.4286,0.5186
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. It's lags. And we actually, in the fourth quarter, made some agreements on pricing that will come into play in the first quarter more than they did in the fourth quarter. And it didn't drive deposit volumes higher in fourth quarter but it is something that as we try to do more fine-tuned predictions of what first quarter would look like. It's something that we factored in. We think that costs will be higher. And that's part of the reason why even though we ended it at [ $501 million ] and I indicated that December was better than November and October, we think we're still going to be flat to down a little bit in the first quarter, largely because of that pricing element. 
And in general, we do -- our view is that as the Fed does reduce rates, we're going to have client conversations about it. And again, we're not a price setter but highly committed to making sure our clients leave their deposits here.",negative,0.2614,0.4493,0.2893

I'm curious how you would approach a hypothetical year where revenue growth comes in a lot better than expected and what that might mean for expense growth. I guess the core question is, what takes precedent, your expense-to-fee ratio or the absolute level of expense growth this year?",neutral,0.0553,0.0446,0.9001
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"I'll start and Mike may want to add to it. Historically, we'd say, well, we want to grow and -- but we have talked about ensuring that we were committed to more of an absolute number in terms of the expenses. And we've also committed to more scalable growth. And so we're already having conversations internally about ensuring that we're highly disciplined on bringing on business that is scalable. And so I think that is a change relative to how we've thought about it before, where there was more of a desire to bring on business at always at attractive margin. But our commitment to scalable growth is going to be -- is higher at this point.

And we -- and there's just been highly variable. And I think our ability to predict just over the last couple of quarters has been really hard. But I feel really good about the volumes that stayed in place. And so I think our approach has worked but it's going to make it less predictable.  It's the opposite of what we just talked about on the expense side, ironically, where we're saying we want to be more predictable on the expenses to try and get that expense-to-trustee ratio where we want it to be. On the deposit side, there's more flexibility and more willingness to follow where the market goes to make sure we're holding on the client assets.",neutral,0.1818,0.067,0.7512

32,Robert Carr Rutschow,,"This is Rob Rutschow, for Mike. Just wanted to follow up on the custody commentary a little bit more. As we calculated, your fees assets under custody were down about 5% year-over-year. You mentioned client outflows. So how much of that is kind of risk off versus actual pricing pressure. What is -- what was the new business this year? And what's the outlook for pricing pressure versus new business as we look into '24?",negative,0.0119,0.9039,0.0842
42,Michael Gerard Oâ€™Grady,,"Yes, I'll start and then, Jason, you can fill it out. But first of all, I just think you need to take into account that we are compensated sometimes on the asset level, sometimes on the transaction levels. And transaction volumes were lower during the year. So that drove some of the weakness in the custody fees there. 
From a pricing perspective, I would say nothing in particular as far as the competitive environment that is driving custody pricing to much lower levels, if you will, I would say it's relatively stable on the pricing front there.",negative,0.1574,0.6003,0.2423
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"And as I look at just the underlying details of how we did, I think you're leaning more towards the asset servicing business. The net new business for the year was positive. And year-over- -- I'm just thinking year-over-year for the quarter and asset servicing hit its mark on net new business. The issue with the company is some of the other things happening as we get into transactions and then what we referenced earlier, in our clients going through their asset levels declining but much less of a repricing story relative to prior years. And the business is winning. If we just look at their win rate in the market, it is strong. So a lot of this year, the impact came from these other dynamics of lower transaction volumes and same number of clients but less assets.",positive,0.4395,0.2371,0.3234
32,Robert Carr Rutschow,,"Okay. And if I could follow up on wealth. I guess, can you talk about the competitive dynamic there and especially in Global Family Office, you saw a little bit of deceleration in the growth rate. Any changes or any areas that you're looking to grow, inside the U.S. or out?",neutral,0.0683,0.0358,0.8959
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"You're right to call it. GFO had a lower -- much lower growth rate than it has over the last couple of years. It's been -- the last couple of years have been excellent for that business. And this year was weaker but we always talk about the fact that is the spikiest business that we have, very small number of client activity can lead to meaningful change. And it's also one of the businesses where with what happens underneath from an investment management perspective can have a meaningful impact on how the business is doing. 
But we've actually invested heavily in that business. They've got a lot of accomplishments in technology and some of the things that they have done with their Wealth Passport, their overall technology platform, we feel is industry-leading -- it is industry leading. Just the way that they've -- they're now interacting with clients from that platform perspective, what clients are able to do with multiple accounts and reporting and client asset movement -- all coming -- and a lot of -- and it's all cloud-enabled, is what we've done recently. And so it's highly, at the -- market leading from our view in terms of what we're doing. And we're continuing to invest in that business from a technology perspective. So there's more coming, which makes us feel very optimistic about what that business is going to do over the next couple of years.",neutral,0.1701,0.0496,0.7802
