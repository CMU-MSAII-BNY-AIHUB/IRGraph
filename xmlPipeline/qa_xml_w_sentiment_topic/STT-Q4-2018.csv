48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes in the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,neutral,0.0356,0.0456,0.9188
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Further comment on the pricing because I think we all get that the market dropped and so fees started out lower, that's -- I don't think it's a surprise at this point. The worst pricing, what I'm curious about is how it manifests itself. In other words, I think you used the phrase this year. I mean, this year is like 2 weeks old. So are we talking about each new contract that comes up as it comes up and it kind of rolls over like the next 5 years? I just want to get -- understand a little bit more about what's new about the -- because pricing has gone down like for the last 30 years straight.",negative,0.033,0.6463,0.3207
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. Glenn, this is Ron. Let me start on that, and then Eric will probably want to say something on it. The way pricing works in the -- or historically has worked in this business, and particularly for us since our business is disproportionately for asset managers, is that when you reprice, there are some assumptions built in around market and as importantly, around flows. I mean, if you serve asset managers, you get the business and then over time, it accumulates. We've gone through -- the industry has gone through a very large number of repricings for all the reasons that I've outlined earlier in terms of the pressure that clients are under. And those same assumptions, at least on our part, have been applied, and I assume on everybody else's part. We had a year of a very sharp down market and as importantly, no flows. So between the volume of pricing and the fact that the usual kind of assumptions haven't yet played out, that's what's led to: one, our results, particularly towards the latter half of 2018; and second, for our outlook. Now it's -- obviously, we have to, as part of the pricing disciplined that we've talked about, we're rethinking these assumptions in terms of market and how much, if at all, to rely on flows. But that's really what we're referring to here. Do you want to...",neutral,0.0592,0.0673,0.8734
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Glenn, I'd just add that, historically, we've seen pricing headwinds for decades in this business just part of the underlying assumption. There's always some pricing headwinds offset by flows and activity and market appreciation. That's how the structure of the contracts are set up. And those have historically been in the 1.5% to 2% range literally over the last half decade, we've gone back a decade and we've got that history. We've seen closer to 4% headwinds this year. And if we think about the coming year, we expect about the same. That said, we've been renegotiating our contracts, right, and extending term. We've been putting in place some clarity around expectations on volumes and market levels and so forth. And while we're a bit more than halfway through those contract negotiations, the negotiations happened, then the fee changes occur, and then we actually have to live through that. So we're just a bit below the majority of what we are going to need to live through, and that's just part of what we have to navigate. I will say that the fee headwinds tend to hit a little more in the earlier part of the year than the latter part just because of the kind of calendarization, and so that's incorporated in our forecast. The net is that, at the end of the day, this is part of our industry. We feel like this is the wave. It's a larger wave than we've seen in the past and than usual, and we think there will be some reversion to the mean. But that said, it strengthens our resolve and we got to work on expenses.  And we got to take expenses out, we got to improve productivity and we've got to adjust our cost structure to be in line with what the revenues are that we can earn.",neutral,0.2308,0.0706,0.6986
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Great. That actually leads to just -- my other follow-up is, if you could talk about the timing and ramping of, say, both the cost save program because it's more headcount than comp-focused. And then also while we're at it, the timing and ramping of the one but not yet funded pipeline because those could be partial offsets as well, obviously.",neutral,0.0821,0.025,0.8929
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Let me start on the expense side because that's -- I've been spending a lot of my time personally with Ron and the management team on that. And I think you saw in my prepared remarks, I gave you a sense of what we expect to do in terms of expenses for the year on an underlying basis down 1%. And because we've been intervening month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter, we expect total expense to be down on underlying basis by about 2 percentage points from 4Q to 1Q. We're trying to adjust the job, and that just comes in stepwise increments. I think at the same time, there are some ramping of some of the ongoing investments that we need to do, and so that's what'll really get the lines to meet at about that 1% down for the year. But we're trying to peel off expenses. We've got a relatively fixed cost base so we've got to take it down in steps. And at the same time, we got to do it carefully so that we continue to serve our clients well and deliver the services in the highest quality manner.",negative,0.0173,0.925,0.0577
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,neutral,0.0305,0.0382,0.9314
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Eric, I was wondering if you could help us flesh out the point you made about not run rating CRD. And can you help us understand just what your expected contribution would be, if possible both on the revenue side for more of a full year '19 basis and also on the cost side? I think what you've given us is the underlying on the expense, but it'd be helpful if you can give us a sense of how you're thinking about the CRD adds.",neutral,0.1512,0.0114,0.8374
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure. Let me describe CRD in a little more detail, and I think we provided the fourth quarter P&L here on Page 10 of the material. Think about it this way, revenues have a seasonality in CRD because of the kind of natural calendarization that happens in sales in a software-oriented business. And I think you'll see that in most of the software businesses that your or some of your colleagues may cover. We disclosed that we -- that the fourth quarter is typically 30% to 35% of full year revenue. That's a rough amount. It'll vary a bit, but that's probably at least something to start with. And so part of the guidance I gave in total fees for 4Q to 1Q includes the natural downtick that you'd see after that fourth quarter seasonal position. And I think you can kind of build models off of that. In terms of expenses, these are our first quarterly expenses. What we are doing in CRD is all the things you'd expect and we've described, right.  We're tackling those 80 or 90 engagements, client engagements. We've begun to build out the sales force further, that was part of our intentions. We've added and we are adding product engineers for installation because that tends to be the bottleneck not just sales but actually the ability to install and to install in a timely manner. So the expenses for CRD will ramp during the year as we integrate. That's all part of the accretion/dilution analysis that -- and commitments we made. And so I think you've got to assume some ramp that would be representative of what you might do where you to run a software company, where you're trying to effectively double the revenue growth rate because that is the underlying goal. Remember, the original -- the growth rate in this business, historically, over the last 4 or 5 years, has been about 7% top line. The kind of on Charles River synergies should take that through a series of different actions to double that.  And so we're going to need to invest in the earlier quarters and the years, too, to deliver on that.",neutral,0.0952,0.039,0.8658
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. Got it. And then if I just kick that back up to the top of the house, I think the comments you gave us on the fees were on an all-inclusive basis. So if I think about what you just added on the CRD, what's your concept of just the -- and I know it's harder given your opening comments, but just the ability to deliver positive operating leverage and given the tougher market environment and some of the pricing points and how are you going to -- how you're trying to balance that? Can you do positive fee operating leverage with this outlook? Or is it just going to be one of those, hey, we got to make it through this and then the longer term, we come back to it as the market improves?",neutral,0.2676,0.014,0.7184
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Ken, it's more of the latter, to be honest, right.  I've been real clear about the change in the market environment just over the last 1.5 months, right, whether it's equity market levels, whether it's even lower flows. I think December long-term outflows between U.S. and Europe were -- just in December were $100 billion negative. Through November of the year, they weren't even $200 billion negative. So this -- and then we have all the geopolitical and macroeconomic and trade questions, and so we're -- that makes us feel that we should be conservative and careful in how we run the company. And as a result, I think what we've done here as part of our prepared remarks is be real clear about what we can do and should be doing on expenses. We are -- we think there's a range -- I think there's a range of scenarios on revenues. And what I'd rather do is just give you good visibility into the coming quarter or quarters on revenue as I get that and then real commitments on the expenses and just be in touch as developments change.",neutral,0.0904,0.0433,0.8663
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Ken, what I would add to that is that we believe we need to manage the company with this somewhat muted outlook. There's so much uncertainty out there in terms of the macro environment, what it means for markets and what it means for investor flows. Having said that, we continue to be very encouraged by the client activity that we see. Some of it Charles River-driven, some of it driven simply by our increase in service quality and the drive for our clients to think about more consolidation. But we really do understand that those macro effects can actually overwhelm anything that we might do, and that I'm actually confident we will do on the revenue side, so it makes sense for us to manage the company with expense basis with that muted outlook.",neutral,0.2279,0.0519,0.7201
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS.,neutral,0.026,0.0497,0.9243
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Just want to try to think about this in the context of the medium-term targets that you guys laid out in early December. I believe the targets included a 10% to 15% GAAP EPS. And it was my understanding that, that was the one medium-term metric that actually intended to apply for each year. It would apply to actually 2019. So number one, now that we know GAAP EPS for '18 is at $6.40, I want to make sure that, that is still intact. And then maybe help me understand how to get there because to think about adding in CRD operating expenses of $160 million in amortization and such to the expense guide that you've given in the deck with net of the cuts you're making.  And then also layering in, Eric, your reference to some sustained fee rate pressure which seems like we had stability in 4Q but maybe you're indicating that, that was -- that's temporary and we should think about some further fee rate pressure from here. So maybe -- I might not be thinking about it correctly, hopefully, you can provide some clarity.",neutral,0.162,0.0393,0.7987
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brennan, it's Eric. Let me take that. We made some very clear commitments for the medium term across a series of different financial elements from capital return to reigniting revenue growth, EPS and [ opportunities ] and so forth. I think in the last 1.5 months, as I said in my prepared remarks, the environment has really changed for this year, 2019. And whether it's the equity markets off 10%, whether it's long-term flows racking one of the worst months of the last few years, whether it's the geopolitical and economic environment getting -- taking another step down or sideways, we now think there's a wider range of revenue scenarios than I think we consciously had in mind in early December as we put up those medium targets -- medium-term targets. So I think from my perspective is we are going to hold to the medium-term targets. I think the 2019 year itself is going to be a more challenging one. And at this point, what I'd not like to do is be too optimistic. I think a year ago in this call, we were a bit too optimistic as the environment changed and didn't react quickly enough. And I think our perspective is we've got to take a more conservative perspective here and update you as it comes. But I think 2019 will be more challenging than we had expected just a couple months ago.",neutral,0.1466,0.1913,0.6621
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. Great. Good to know my math isn't totally way off. And then thinking about the deposit cost front for my follow-up, you guys continue to show a 50% beta, which is encouraging.  Looks like the likelihood of a further rate hike has deteriorated. So can you walk us through maybe how we should think about deposit cost pressure and your expectations for deposit cost in a 2019 where we don't see further increases in short-term rates? Could we still continue to see upward pressure on that deposit cost? And what are your expectations there?",neutral,0.2198,0.3671,0.4131
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure, Brennan. Deposit costs and betas will continue to float upwards. I think we've been -- 2 years ago, early on, we were in the 20% range for betas. We moved into the 30%, 35% range for a while. This year, we're right smack in the middle of the 50%, 55% range. And we certainly expect that during the year, that will continue to tick up. And we've seen that in other firms, and so that's inherent in our forecast. We think it'll jump up to very, very high levels, not -- we don't have any indication that, that would be the case. And so we just expect the continued grind up of betas and the continued modest transition from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing. I think one of the things that gives us confidence in the NII outlook of low single digits to mid-single digits is that just by virtue of the 4Q step-off, right, we build off of that during the course of the year as we've expanded our client coverage program.  One of the earliest efforts that Ron and I started, I'd say it was probably about a year ago, was actually client engagement on deposits, right, the full suite of what they need to do with their cash. And that, in our minds, has actually really solidified the deposit gathering with our clients and gives us some capability to put the right amount of volume of deposits on our balance sheet. And so what we would like to do this year and, obviously, subject to ebbs and flows in the market, is not only hold deposits steady, but see if we can drive them up somewhat because that would be part of how we deploy the balance sheet in a positive way. And if we can do that, plus get some of that high-quality lending that the 40 Act Fund, leverage fund needs or the private equity capital call lending that they need. That would be -- that would also be positive. So there are a couple of different dimensions there that we're working on to drive some growth in this coming year.",neutral,0.4401,0.0169,0.5431
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0311,0.0424,0.9265
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So I was hoping we can double-click on some of the things we talked about here in more detail. So I guess starting with fee pressure. So I guess, one, I guess what gives you guys confidence that the pressure will normalize beyond 2019? So sort of why doesn't the 4% annual drag doesn't continue beyond that period? And if you guys could provide a little bit of color in terms of customer segments in particular, client types, geographies, things like that, to help us get a better flavor of where the pain points are?",neutral,0.09,0.0198,0.8903
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Alex, this is Ron. I think that where it begin on that is that the -- much of the pricing discussions have occurred and started in earnest with a combination of the ongoing pressure on the big active managers or managers, in general, but certainly big active managers, while at the same time markets were running up and clients were seeing that State Street and BNY Mellon, everybody else who's gathering more revenues were doing really the same things. So it led to what we would view as an accelerated amount and a heightened amount of fee discussions. As Eric outlined though, when we -- as we've gone into this period, one, we've moved and pretty much insisted upon term for our pricing, so to -- in other words, to make it a little less variable than it's been in the past. And second, in most cases we've actually gathered more business as part of the pricing discussion. So the reason why we feel confident that it will abate, it's never going to go away, but it will abate is: one, as Eric noted, I think we're through about just over 50% of our clients in terms of discussions on this, little bit more than that. And for the ones that we've done it, we've extended term and gotten more business. So that's why we would feel that this is a bit of a cyclical low here, but feel confident that it should improve.",positive,0.5429,0.0582,0.3989
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Alex, it's Eric. I'd just also say that this is, obviously, a phenomenon that started in the U.S. U.S. managers were under more pressure sooner and earlier, right, because of the flow of active to passive. We've had, now, similar discussions in Europe. There, we think it's not going to be quite as difficult partly because the kind of the ETF mutual fund differential isn't as sizable, but we'll see. So it's affecting though, primarily, the asset managers of the segment that's seeing where those are most intense. And a little less so some of the other insured or insurance-type companies. That said, we've had run-ups in the marketplace. And often times, these fee renegotiations become more intense after run-ups in the marketplace. Why? Because if you just think about yourself being an asset manager, right, you're paying us on fees that are scaled to market levels.  Markets appreciate, you look at your bill, your bill's going up. And your natural inclination will be, ""Well, let me go and talk to my bill provider about how can I get some of that back?"" And so we have seen, as we've gone back for half a decade, a decade or more, some connection between run-up in markets followed by more severe adjustments in pricing. And so I think if we get some normalization to kind of more steady growth in the market, we think we'll get some reversion of the mean. Whether this 4% level goes back to the 1.5% to 2%, we'll see. Whether it goes back to somewhere between them, we'll see. And obviously, as we see more, we'll share more with you.",neutral,0.1832,0.0405,0.7763
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Great. That's helpful color. And then my second question was around securities lending. Looking at $120 million run rate this quarter, can you help break out what's kind of still Enhanced Custody versus traditional agency model? And again, assuming environment stays roughly the same, is this sort of the low at $120 million run rate? Or you guys are still working through how to reposition Enhanced Custody business for CCAR? I thought you said earlier in the call that that's still a bit ongoing so I'm just trying to get a better sense of what the jumping off point is.",neutral,0.0618,0.043,0.8952
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, at this point, the revenues in securities lending were, let's see, about $120 million for the quarter. It's roughly 60-40, 55-45 classic agency lending versus Enhanced Custody. So it's kind of in that range. I think the -- there are 2 things going on right now in this area, and it's really around the agency area.  I think we've seen some stability -- reasonable stability in Enhanced Custody. But on the classic agency lending, we've seen some real market with market levels stalling. You have -- there are just -- asset loans are lower. We've seen deleveraging by some of the hedge funds who need to borrow or lend, and so there is less demand out there. And as a result, spreads have come down as well. I think the question is, what happens -- one question is, what happens to market levels and demand in first quarter? And if you remember, we ended December, I think at close to 10% below S&P levels for October, November. We've had a little bit of a bounce back. But if that persists, we're still likely to have a lower average -- highly likely to have a lower average first quarter than fourth quarter. And so that's going to create some dampening measures on demand, and you still have some hedge funds continue to deleverage. So there's clearly a market demand element here that makes us feel careful about the 4Q to 1Q, and is embedded in my sequential fee guidance. I think the other part is the counterparty work that we've had to do with CCAR does have more of an effect on sec lending. And while I think we've been through most of it, I don't think we've been through all of it in the agency space, which is kind of just a little more than half of sec lending. In FX, I think we've done a terrific job in diversifying counterparties, innovating, doing compression trades, right.  The tools are quite vast, and the number of counterparties out there are quite significant. And the teams really turned on a dime to kind of adjust their processes. In agency lending, it's much more concentrated business. There is fewer kind of transaction types available to us, and so it's something we're working through and need a little bit of time on. That said, I would tell you agency lending and securities lending and Enhanced Custody continues to be an area of innovation for us. There's the question, how can you structure trades and various approaches to actually refine and actually connect counterparties as opposed to always be the intermediary and still earn a fee and effectively add innovation in what's been a historically unchanged marketplace? So more to come on that, and we'll certainly talk more over the coming quarters.",negative,0.0983,0.5373,0.3644

5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Eric, just a follow-up on that. Could you give us a sense of if you ran through your new positioning on last year's CCAR, how much it would have changed the results?",neutral,0.0788,0.0164,0.9048
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"I'm chuckling, Betsy, because that's the question we -- our capital team would like to ask the Fed, right.  That's the -- how do you -- how do the models work? I'd tell you this, that on the investment portfolio, we and I think the other large banks have done quite a bit of work on the mark-to-market effect and how the mark-to-market on the OCI positions could be modeled. And we've now got 5, 6 -- I think we've got 6 or more data points, but they're data points with changing portfolios. So how much is it worth? It's -- I think we've got a range of estimates. I think the reason we felt comfortable saying that we're optimistic about our capital position is if you think about it, if we have earnings of what it's been, $2.5 billion, $3 billion a year, we know much we'd like to return. We know what every 10 percentage points of those earnings are in terms of capital return. And so if 10 percentage points of capital return is $300 million, right, we have some sense for how much you'd have to adjust the mark-to-market impact to create another 10 percentage points or 20 percentage points of return. And that's kind of the math we've done. So I don't really want to be in a position to predict AOCI impacts on our portfolio. We could all do rough estimates, but that's how we thought about it, and that's maybe the -- kind of the quantitative context I'd share with you.",neutral,0.0569,0.051,0.8921
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then just separately, the Fed's talked about proposing CCAR stress tests that's only run on RWAs and not on leverage ratios. Have you thought through what that could mean for you?",neutral,0.0432,0.0319,0.925
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I think we've done the modeling of that. I think there's been a fair amount of outside in modeling. And right now, I think Tier 1 leverage is our binding constraint under the stress test. The difference between a Tier 1 leverage binding constraint versus an RWA binding constraint, while it's not perfectly discernible, rough estimates, $1 billion range, maybe $1.5 billion. But it kind of depends on exactly how the test is run, what the timing is of the various market factors and so forth. But that has some real material benefit, and I think we are optimistic that with the Crapo Bill having passed and the Fed working on the implementation of that and some of the Vice Chairman's comments that there is some real movement, it's just a matter of time, and hopefully months, not quarters, when we hear more. But it'll be -- it's an important positive force.",neutral,0.2693,0.018,0.7127
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then just a little bigger picture. I know you've talked a bit about if-then scenarios on revenues and expenses, and I guess I'm just trying to understand if you have a more muted revenue outlook. Ron, maybe you could just give us a sense as to, do you have to invest to get further cost saves? Or do you feel like there still is opportunity? I think I know you did a big restructuring here, and I'm just trying to understand, is further potential expense opportunities really incremental? Or is there more wood that you've chopped?",neutral,0.1169,0.0496,0.8335
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. So we've -- what we've done is going after the expenses that, one, we just should go after. And second, what we believe we need to go after, given what you're hearing from us, is a cautious outlook going forward. If your question is, is there more to go after, of course, there is. And we've got -- we've noted a comprehensive program in place that we actually expect to be able to drive more. We also have the work that's been done in the past that I can't emphasize enough in terms of Beacon, the work that's underway in terms of consolidating our delivery and all of our operations, and those efforts will continue to pay off in 2019 and beyond. And then finally, to the extent to which we saw an environment that was even worse than the cautious one that you're hearing from us, we'd obviously start to look at things like the pattern of investment. I mean we -- that's the last thing we'll go after because we do believe that it's important. We have what we think is a sensible investment program adjusted to the opportunities and market realities.

7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Maybe I'll just start with expenses and then move on to revenue growth question. So first, just on expenses, just to sort of clarify for 2019, I'm getting basically to about an $8.6 billion core expense run rate, and what you exclude from that is the CRD amortization and any CRD acquisition-related expenses. But it would also include delivery cost to achieve the revenue synergy that you outlined when you did the deal, which would be some portion of that 180 to 200. And maybe if you can -- Eric, if you can talk about how you're looking at those delivery costs for 2019 and then the trajectory of expenses going into 2020, given that we're potentially gliding down on expenses and saves as the year to come.",neutral,0.0429,0.1249,0.8321
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Brian, it's Eric. Let me try to do this from a couple of different interactions. I think Page 16 in the deck was -- is probably a helpful starting point because we kind of defined the underlying 2018 expenses.  As you know, that's ex CRD and so forth.  And then where we expect those to end at the end of '19. I think you do need to take -- put CRD in there. We talked about the first quarter, scale it up. And I think while we will be investing, I'd ask you to think through how quickly can you invest well in a business, right.  There's a little bit of a bounding limit there. And if you're at a $40 million run rate in 4Q, it's just -- think about -- I think there's a range, but I think you can quickly come to what's reasonable versus non-reasonable set of expense growth rate off of that level. So I think you can work off of that. You do have to factor in the intangible amortization, which we've defined there, and then the acquisition and restructuring costs will also flow through. I think this quarter is a good example of what a run rate could be on a quarterly basis, but we'll obviously take those as they come, in line with the actions we take and the appropriate accounting. So those are the pieces. Happy to work with you and our IR team to take a look at how you're modeling it out and take things from there.",neutral,0.0878,0.0197,0.8925
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Okay. We'll do that offline. And then just on the revenue side, maybe, Ron, if you could just characterize how those conversations are going. You mentioned the 98 client engagements with Charles River customers, and if you could give some perspective -- maybe some refreshed perspective on the trajectory of revenue synergies.  Appreciate that that's a 2021 goal, but if you could sort of give us a sense of how optimistic you are on winning new business from the game plan of talking with the CRD clients and the concept that you mentioned at the outset of the pressure the asset managers are facing on whether they're very receptive to the partnering concepts.",neutral,0.2151,0.0113,0.7736
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. So let me start with the question on optimism. We're very optimistic about achieving, if not exceeding, those revenue synergy goals. The nature of the conversations, let me give you some sense of those. Some of them are simply that they're CRD clients. They like the new owner. The new owner is in private equity. So we still see stability, and there's just more CRD activity happening, more movement from shrinkwrap to cloud, all of which is good from a revenue and profitability perspective from CRD. There's also a series of client conversations where it may be a State Street client with no CRD presence or a CRD client that sees the value of having more of their activities with State Street and CRD together. And the attraction of those, of course, is simplification of the internal operations and operating stack and technology stack. And then there's a set of conversations that we, in all honesty, hadn't expected to be having, which is clients where we either don't serve them now or we serve them in a minimal way or even in a couple of cases, where there was a competitive bidding situation and we lost typically for price that are all being looked at again. So it's pervasive. It's comprehensive, and it's driven by all these things we talk about in the marketplace, which are real negatives to short-term revenues but we think are real positives to seeing more business consolidate with us and us having in the end a much higher share of the wallet.",neutral,0.166,0.02,0.814

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"It's a little bit too early to tell on whether the pattern is going to change, Brian, because these are pretty comprehensive discussions. You try and move them along as fast as you can, but they take time because you're really talking about a once-in-a-generation change in these firms in terms of how they're going to run their business. So right now, we're sticking to the time frame, but I would emphasize that we're highly confident in achieving the amount.",neutral,0.1782,0.0159,0.8059
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,neutral,0.0364,0.0397,0.9239
41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"First question, it's on expenses. I guess I want to kind of step away from the expense program, $350 million, but you're just thinking about sort of the core business. Maybe like what has been done to make the cost structure maybe more variable, just given some of the uncertainties that you have on the revenue side, some of the pricing trends that you're seeing? And basically, the revenue is going to be tough to predict. I'm just trying to gauge when you think some of the lines like comp, transaction, other, like how much of that is variable that can kind of ebb and flow with the revenue backdrop versus what's fixed or more structural?",neutral,0.0456,0.0928,0.8616
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Mike, it's Eric. Let me start on that one because the nature of our business has actually become in terms of expenses more fixed than variable. It's partly that as we automate, as we put more capital work and labor, we need to make that shift be even more dramatic, to be honest. And I think as Ron described, we feel good about some of the investments we've made in some of the automation, but I don't think we've sufficiently adjusted the stack of labor that we have against it. But our business is actually becoming more fixed than variable over time, and I think that means 2 things. I think that means from an expense program and programmatic standpoint, we need to find ways to take out step level, kind of step function expenses off of the -- out of our expense base. So as we automate, we need to take labor out. As we work with vendors, we need to find ways to adjust downward as we get larger and they get larger and we force the scale benefits to accrue to both parties. So that's part of what we just need to do because of the nature of how this business has evolved relative to where it was as a highly manual, a highly variable business 10, 20, 30 years ago. I think the second perspective that we've developed as a senior team here is because it's more fixed than variable, we actually need to find ways that in good times we create more margin expansion and more leverage. Because in truth, while we have an ability to take some stepwise and step function reductions in the expenses in difficult times, it's hard to adjust the level that we would like given that revenues could move as much as they are moving up or down. And so I think our historic belief that we should run with operating leverage of maybe a point in good time, but I think that's not really something that makes sense as we step back and think about how this business has been operated. It may have made sense in the past, but that's something that we need to change. And so we first need to work through this particular market environment, but that gives you at least some context as to how we're thinking about this going forward as well.",neutral,0.1225,0.0404,0.837
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Mike, I want to add to Eric's last point there because I think a part of the challenge that we're facing now is that in the past, the costs have been too variable as the business has grown. And it's not that there were -- people were being spendthrift. It's we had these distributed operations, and we just weren't achieving scale benefits as rapidly as we should have -- as we could have been. With the work that's been done over the last year, not just Beacon but this consolidation of our operations into this global delivery group and the creation and running of these hubs, that is the goal, is to achieve much better scale benefits. And as a consequence, we should be able to deliver what Eric is talking about in terms of in good times actually, more operating leverage than we have in the past.",neutral,0.3553,0.0148,0.63
41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. You guys mentioned some of the pricing challenges across most of the assets or with your asset management industry we're seeing that. But when you think about some of the other products, services that you're offering, where are you seeing the areas where you're not seeing maybe the same level of pressure, there's more maybe growth opportunity that you can allocate resources to?",neutral,0.1338,0.0169,0.8493
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Mike, it's Eric. I think it -- the answer to your question really is around the product stack that we offer. If you think about it, custody, for example, is the most commoditized of our products. Then there's accounting. Then there's fund administration, the prospectus creation. Then there is middle office, where I think we've actually gotten to be better about how we -- and smarter about how we price and operate that business. So as you move up the product stack, I think we see -- and actually more recently with some of the new SEC reporting requirements and so forth, we see more-- pricing power. And I think, in fact, in terms of something like CRD, our software, there's actually effectively inflation escalators in contracts because of the nature of that business and of that industry. So part of this is kind of where you are in the stack, which actually I think encourages us to continue to pivot and make sure that when we're operating the custody, we also do accounting. When we do accounting, we also do administration, so on and so forth. And so that's maybe a little bit of flavor as to where you have strength. I think the other place is we have found that where we have clients that are moving in different directions, deleveraging or what have you, and as their books adjust downwards, we have gone back and said, ""Look, we need to adjust pricing accordingly."" And in particular in the hedge fund space, that's been an important part of the back and forth. And then lastly, I'll tell you, the other place that we're working through as pricing is not only as we have price discussions we ask for wallet and more share of wallet in a much more rigorous and disciplined manner and controlled manner which Ron and I have put in place with some of our most senior folks, we have very rigorous processes there.  But we've also had very active discussions about being paid for in different ways, being paid for with more deposits left with us than with some of the other players. And that's been another area where I think we found some ability to be paid appropriately for the service we provide.",neutral,0.1001,0.0271,0.8728

49,James Francis Mitchell,,"Maybe just follow-up on -- Eric, on your outlook on NII and NIM. If the Fed were to stop, I mean, historically, State Street has seen leverage once the Fed stops as assets reprice and deposit betas typically -- or deposit repricing has to stop pretty quickly because you have high deposit betas during rate hikes, and then stop.  Sounds like you didn't, I guess, reinforce that view. So has something changed? Or should we -- how do you think about Fed -- deposit pricing once the Fed stops? And given where your securities portfolio yield is, it's still well below 2% 2-year treasury. Should we expect your securities yield to grind a little higher over once the Fed stops? So just thoughts on NIM.",neutral,0.0705,0.1392,0.7903
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, let me tackle it from a couple of different directions. I think if the Fed stops now, there are a couple ways that we will get some incremental growth in NII. First, you just get the fourth quarter run rate over the earlier quarters, will create a full year effect in '19 relative to '18. That's the first piece. The second piece, as you described, is as the investment portfolio tractor continues to work upwards, and that's where we continue to have investment coupons higher than those that are falling off, it's a little more complicated for our book because we operate not only in the U.S. geography but also the international geography, but that's -- there is more there. I think, third, there is a continued mixing of the portfolio. We've historically ran with a very large kind of a barbelled portfolio of credit and treasuries. I think you've seen in some of the changes that we made the first quarter of '18 and in the fourth quarter of '18, you've seen we've shifted into more of a agency MBS portfolio that gives us some pickup relative to treasuries, and then we've also shifted in the foreign sovereigns, it's -- you can't see directly, but out of some of the sovereign versus some of the supras and also -- and the other types of global government agencies. So we think there is some amount of grind upwards. And then I think the final one, which in some ways is most connected to the business, is how do we continue to engage with our clients on cash and how do we find ways to create better solutions for them on cash, right.  And I think that's where it's not only their cash position, but it's their need for repo whether it's direct repo or FICC repo, it's their money market sweeps and so forth. And so each one of those is a very engaged conversation. To the extent that we can drive some amount of volume growth, we feel like that can fall to the bottom line. And that, we'll just -- we can just report on as we see developments.",neutral,0.0919,0.0337,0.8744

45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"No. I think you get a little bit of a tail end of December flowing through the first quarter, but you get some relative stability in deposit pricing, I think on a direct basis. I think the question is, is how much competition is there out there? In a flat rate environment, I think what happens is what happens to the competition for the deposits in the banking system. And while we don't directly compete, there is always some spillover effect. And so if we get a situation where lending grows relatively quickly for a time period, back to the 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% range and banks need to fund that lending with deposits and there's more deposit composition, then you can see pricing go in the favor of clients and against the favor of the banks. I don't think we see that at this point, but we're always watching carefully.",neutral,0.0848,0.055,0.8602
49,James Francis Mitchell,,"All right. Okay. And then as a follow-up question, just on your revenue -- fee revenue forecast, can you just, for our modeling purposes, help us understand what market levels you're kind of assuming? I see that in the footnote, you talked about 5% growth from December levels. Obviously, right now, we're up 6% to 8% in the U.S. depending on which index. What are you assuming in your first and second quarters to give us that kind of fee guidance?",neutral,0.3603,0.0168,0.6229
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"At this point, what we've got is we've started off of the December 31 step off. We did that for the U.S. and for the international markets as well. I'm a little cautious on a particular quarter so just that's why I gave some guidance on total fees for 1Q because the way our pricing works is some of it's geared to the, literally the month end. Some of it's geared to daily averages. Sometimes it's a 2-point average. And so there's a mix, and so it was not helpful that you get that December 31 print. And I think the other part that's going on here is flows and client activity matter, right.  I think in my remarks, I described that flow -- because the natural course of business on flows -- and remember, we get -- because of the size of our business in the U.S. and in EMEA for asset managers, we get about 1/3 of the inflows that you see in the industry, we get that in our books and records, right, in our custodial accounts. But those kinds of flows and then the client activity, all that transactional activity is material. That's historically been worth 2 percentage points of growth over the course of -- annually, right.  And right now, we're not seeing very much of that at all, and so that's another reason why we are quite cautious on the first quarter, and we added a little bit of wording around that as well.",neutral,0.072,0.1162,0.8118

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"A quick question on the market sensitivity that you gave. I mean, you mentioned that a 5% uplift is $25 million of servicing fees. So I mean, if you put that relative to what the 2018 revenues are, it's about 1% revenue uptick for the 5% uplift in the markets. So last quarter, when you gave that, it was 10%. It gives you a 3% increase, so a 30% pull-through rate. This quarter bounced down to a 20% pull-through rate. So when you finish all these renegotiations that you have ongoing, how does the market sensitivity look when all's said and done?

45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Brian, it's Eric. I think the -- I think we gave relatively consistent guidance. So the historical guidance I've given in our -- is around 10% change in equity market is worth about 3 percentage points, so on a base of $5 billion of servicing fees, right, that's about $150 million. I think what I said earlier today in my prepared remarks is that 5 percentage points, about 10, is worth about 25 a quarter, but you lose part of that first quarter. So you get a little more than 75. You get, call it, 85 to 90. So you're kind of within the range of that 10% and 3%, which would give you $150 million.

On the pricing side, I don't think we have really seen shifts in pricing and pricing structures at this point. I mean, at this point, we still have pricing, which has asset levels as the basis. We have some pricing that is around transactional fees, and then we have some pricing that's fixed. But there's still some real variability baked into our pricing, and we don't see that pricing structure as having changed in new contracts that we're negotiating now relative to those that we've had. It's where the level of pricing has been adjusted downwards, and what we're trying to do in several different ways is put controls around our internal processes on how those are negotiated, what we get for them not only in terms of servicing fees in markets and FX and securities lending and deposits but also who's engaged at what level of seniority in those discussions.

What assurance can you give that savings will be sustainable? And what is your new pretax margin target? And before answering, here is what's in my head. State Street said that it achieved all savings from business ops and IT transformation and almost all the savings from Project Beacon and set a target at the start of the decade to improve the pretax margin from 29% in 2010 to 33%. But over this 8-year period, State Street not only missed its own pretax margin target, but the pretax margin declined from 29% in 2010 to 28% last year. So while the pretax margin got worse over 8 years, State Street took victory laps on earnings calls and press releases and its proxy. And Ron, I noticed this predates you. But still, this is a question, to what extent is the board looking after shareholder interest? To what extent would State Street apply clawbacks to the prior CEOs' pay? Jay, a Grade A person. He's always treating me well. You guys have given me access. But at some point, don't you have to look at the business and say, ""Well, actually, the targets were not met.""

One, there's been a lot of work done, and I keep coming back to Beacon, I keep coming back to what we're doing in terms of consolidating operations that we have not realized the full promise from. We need to accelerate that, but this is not something that we're just thinking about. This is actually work that's underway, that's been completed, and we need to make sure that we realize the benefits from that. Two, as we were talking about earlier, the business -- as revenues have come on in this firm, costs have gone up almost at the same rate. We have not gotten sufficient scale advantages. Because of the work that's been done, and frankly because of the way we're going to manage the business going forward, we will capture more scale benefits. Three, the board is very involved in this. We've worked with them on our new performance management and accountability system. And there's a very, very close tie, more so than ever, between pay and performance. And so we've got incentives aligned across firms, so I am confident we will deliver on what we said here. And we need to do that because we understand that, firstly, just to be in a position to be able to service the business that we see coming down the road, we have to achieve all this. Secondly, we recognize that while there are certain things we can't control, there's a lot of things we can, such as markets, such as client flows and things like that. So therefore, that's why we need to redouble the efforts around there, so in those periods like a 2018, that we don't see that thing kind of fall off.",neutral,0.3185,0.0252,0.6562

We do disclose the mix of some of the AUCAs in our supplement mix of equities in -- for our asset management business. And then obviously, sec lending is a heavy equity-based underlying business. So I do think that we have a higher equity exposure than kind of the servicing industry in aggregate. I don't know that I have an excellent estimate. Because remember, even when custody for funds that are multi-asset funds, there's a wide range. If you do turn to Page 9 in our financial supplement, you will see that there is one cut of our $31.6 trillion of assets under custody, and we described $18 billion of those being equity-based. So I think that's a good indication in the custodial side. And then on the asset management side, we also do the equity cut on Page 10. So it's significant. It's in the -- you can see it's in the 55, 60, 60-ish percentage range, and so we are somewhat dependent on equity market. I think that's why in good times, we need -- we're going to be able to benefit from that, but we also need to make sure that we are heavily -- that we're always careful on expenses and create that scalable cost base so that we don't actually add too many costs in good time so that we can navigate through.

Number two, this assumption, particularly when you're pricing an asset management client, that there'll be both market and fees that will over time actually make what looks like an entry-level price -- takes an entry-level price that may look like it's too thin, kind of make it fuller over time as flows and market help out. When that assumption goes away, it just lays bare that the price that you had as an initial price on a sustained basis in fact isn't sustainable. So at least for us, can't speak for obviously the rest of the industry, it has caused us to be much more careful about how we think about this, that in addition to getting more term so that pricing can't change overnight, looking at what other products, and as Eric talked about earlier, the product stack as you move up from custody becomes -- it tends to be -- it's not price-insensitive but less and less price-sensitive or less and less commodity-like, if you will.

The 2 that we do have are -- under our control are, number one, the shape of the investment portfolio. And if you remember, we made adjustments in the first quarter of last year, where we saw the results and how those play through into CCAR so we had a good understanding of the kind of the change this and then results in that. And then we made some more adjustments the fourth quarter of this year based on some of those learnings and the other 6 data points we've had over the last year. The second one is because of the play we've now better understood the counterparty stress test that the Fed runs, right, we've actively intervened in terms of how we actually structure and limit our counterparty exposures across our businesses, whether that's in FX, whether that's in securities lending. And so we've made very conscious choices, some of which have impacted revenue, and you've seen that in particular in sec lending, to actually adjust our exposure levels. Now we're trying to transact with our best clients as much as we used to before. But in some cases, we've had to be more calibrated. So we have literally -- if we -- if you were to go down to the trading floor and the risk management team, they literally had new parameters that they've installed that we've been operating at since the -- since late summer and early fall. So both of those give us some confidence that we can -- that we should be able to do better this year. The obvious unknown is the test itself, right.  There's the macroeconomic shop, what's in that? There is the global market trading bookshop, which has the counterparty piece to it. And then it's everything else in the test, including assumption for balance sheet growth and so forth.

Just given the Fed's willingness to greenlight payouts north of 100%, the fact that they've clearly indicated that they're loathe to have this binary Pascal outcome, given the confidence level that you have in all the changes that you've made to reposition yourself ahead of CCAR, would you actually look in the near term, maybe exceed that 80% in order to more aggressively mitigate the dilution impact from CRD?",positive,0.6246,0.0157,0.3596
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"We have said that we'd like to, and we're optimistic that we can do better than 80% so that's exactly the intention and hope that we have. And I'll just be clear that there's some of both that's necessary for that, but that is what we'd like to be able to deliver this year, and we believe we've made some of the adjustments necessary at our end of the -- that are under our own control to effectuate that. So we're -- we'd like to be able to deliver on that. That would be our intention, given what we've -- how we're proceeding.",positive,0.5911,0.0137,0.3952

9,Geoffrey Elliott,,"On the income guide, just to be clear, first of all, the 3% to 4% down points to about $2.2 billion. And then annualizing that, we kind of get to an annual run rate of about 8.8 if that was sustained. Is that right?",neutral,0.1131,0.1081,0.7788
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, it's Eric. That's right. I mean, that's -- we're trying to start with where we are today, and we're trying to adjust for the markets, the flows, the limited amount of client transaction activity. And then you have the lumpiness from trading from 4Q to 1Q, right.  So we're -- we always want to be careful and appropriately conservative there. And then there's just the 606 effects of Charles River. So we've tried to factor all that into our estimate. And then we've said that that's a good run rate for several quarters. We'd like that to be just a quarter or 2, not very long, but we're trying to be careful here. And to be honest, we're trying to be careful about revenues because we think if we're doing that, then we're going to be even more effective and adroit at interventions on expenses, and we think that's what we should demand of ourselves and what you would all expect of us. I think the scenarios on revenue though are very wide, to be honest, because there is the range of different market assumptions, flow assumptions and underlying transaction activity. We just have some -- we just have a little more visibility into the first quarter, including the usual adjustments on market flows, macroeconomics and a little bit of pricing, which tends to be a little deeper in the first quarter than the out quarters, just the way the calendar works, and so we're just trying to factor that in. But off of that base, I think there's a range of scenarios, and we'd obviously like to see more positive ones. And if we see those, we will -- we've got a set of conference schedule set up in February and March and in May, where we'll certainly update for changes.",neutral,0.108,0.0403,0.8518
9,Geoffrey Elliott,,"Got it. But it sounds like in the sort of market assumptions that you're showing on Slide 16, that could be a run rate that sticks around for a couple of quarters. Is that fair? I just want to make sure that we're understanding it right.",neutral,0.0954,0.0343,0.8702

16,Vivek Juneja,,"This is Vivek. A couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, Eric, on CRD, the operating margin obviously in Q4, because of ASC 606 just a little bit inflated, what -- on a full year basis, what would you guide us to as a sort of a more normalized operating margin before you put in any cost savings or anything else?",neutral,0.1237,0.0249,0.8514
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Vivek, I think we disclosed back in July an operating margin for that business at around 50% on the old ASC numbers in a live basis. I think the way the current year adjusts a bit, you might get for -- going from 605 to 606, just given the pattern of how they've done the accounting historically versus now, you get a small uptick in margin from there. I think then the modeling becomes -- has probably 2 facets going in. One is the investments that we're making in the business and then the revenue ramp-up relative to those investments. And that, that will tend to trend the margin rate down a bit as we -- in the early year or 2 of building the business.",neutral,0.0743,0.4249,0.5008
16,Vivek Juneja,,"Okay. All right. Good. Because while -- you cautioned us on annualizing the revenues and presuming the cost we can annualize if we are modeling out CRD separately, right?",neutral,0.1548,0.0236,0.8216
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,Yes.,neutral,0.1082,0.0226,0.8692
16,Vivek Juneja,,"Yes, okay. Different question, you called out in your NIM onetime benefits from hedging activities. Can you quantify that? And how much of that in the fourth quarter?",neutral,0.0615,0.0234,0.9151
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. In the fourth quarter, it was about $6 million roughly, and a little bit comes from some of the dislocation [ the -- up front being ] swap market. We've taken our swap positions down over the years, as you know, but there's always some dislocations towards the -- over the holiday season, in particular towards the end of the quarter. So we saw a little bit of that, and it was a positive dislocation because of how the currencies between euro and some of -- and yen actually played through, so that was a positive. And then on long-term debt, you get a little bit of this mark-to-market adjustment in the underlying accounting as you got rates and credit spreads move a little bit. So and about [ $6 ], and it'll just -- which won't reappear in the first quarter.",negative,0.0685,0.7523,0.1792
16,Vivek Juneja,,"Can I sneak in another one?  Which was you combined an accounting with FX and brokerage, I know a lot of -- a part of brokerage used to have electronic FX trading.  What -- the rest of it, things like transition management, have they just diminished through a smaller base or has something else changed?",neutral,0.034,0.1103,0.8558
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"No, I think what we're trying to do is literally simplify the disclosure. And if we did something that took helpful materials away, we can certainly revisit. But we had a line that was historically called total trading services, which is both our direct foreign exchange trading plus our, what I'll call electronic foreign exchange venues, those were in what was called brokerage, and then some of the other kind of fund connect, like our money market electronic venue, a little bit of transition management and a few other smaller items like portfolio solutions. So we've just -- I think we labeled that total FX trading services just to give it the kind of the description that's appropriate. I think within that, I'm just scanning through, about 80% of those revenues are foreign exchange-related. The rest tend to be a little bit of the money market or portfolio solutions-type activity.",neutral,0.0353,0.0366,0.9282
