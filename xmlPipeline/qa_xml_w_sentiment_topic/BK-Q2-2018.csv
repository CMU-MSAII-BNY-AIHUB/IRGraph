0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.,neutral,0.0465,0.0235,0.93
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"So I appreciate the forward-looking guidance. I'm just curious on the deposit migration that you're seeing, the interest-bearing down 12% -- interest-bearing up 7%, noninterest-bearing down 12%. Is that -- do we look for more of the same in the next several quarters that a function of the rate environment? In other words, if we go on the path that is in the forward curve, is it going to be just be chipping away? Or do you see an end to that client behavior? It just has, obviously, a big impact on the modeling.",negative,0.0362,0.7707,0.1932
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Glenn, it's Mike. I'll take that. So I think when you look at the noninterest-bearing as a percentage of the total, it's about where we expected it to be and what we've been saying now for a very long time actually. And so just -- it's just about 30% of the total. And so as we've said a number of times over the last couple years, we would expect that percentage to trend down a little bit below 30 over a period of time. And so it's behaving sort of where we thought it would -- it's right about where we thought it would be.",negative,0.04,0.6494,0.3106
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"It's factored into what â€“ and Glenn, this is Charlie.  That's the way we thought about where it looks like going forward if that continues.",neutral,0.0693,0.0163,0.9144
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,Okay. Might as well finish off this NII combo then. Does the same apply for the modest decline on the loan side and the incremental deposit betas of over 60% this quarter?,negative,0.0527,0.8817,0.0656
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Look, I think on the loan side, that will bounce around from any given quarter. So I wouldn't read into a decline in loans as a go-forward trend that's going to continue to decline. On the deposit betas, recall that there was a rise in March that's fully baked into the second quarter, and there was a stub of -- or another rise in June. And so it's probably a decent indication of where betas are trending right now.",negative,0.1034,0.808,0.0886
0,Operator,,And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0439,0.027,0.929
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Just first question around expenses. Can you provide us an update on the kind of $300 million investment initiative you outlined at the Investor Day? I guess, a, is it still $300 million? How much of the kind of $300 million is already in the run rate? And how we should think about just maybe absolute dollars of expenses as we progress through the year?",neutral,0.0426,0.0256,0.9318
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Alex, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So as we mentioned last quarter, we -- that $300 million investment sort of ramps up throughout the year and so it's not exactly a linear sort of progression throughout the year, but we're sort of midway through the year, and we're sort of approximately at sort of where we expected to be in that sort of ramp-up. And the $300 million sort of plus or minus is still sort of the range that we've been looking at.",neutral,0.2059,0.0748,0.7193
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"The only thing I would add to it is that what we talked about relative to where we had hoped the total expense outcome to be for the company, I wouldn't say there's no meaningful difference there. So to the extent that we decide to spend more money on technology, we will actively seek to manage the overall expense base, and that's still what we're trying to accomplish.",neutral,0.1994,0.0147,0.7859
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Yes. Got you, that makes sense. And my second just a cleanup question around Issuer Services. It seems like there is kind of a different dynamic going on there. You guys are clearly making progress in the Corporate Trust, and DR business has been a lot more muted. As we think about seasonality, I think historically Q3 was a strong quarter for Issuer Services, and it kind of drops off in Q4. How should we think about it, I guess, given the changes in business the way you guys have been reporting it here?",negative,0.1035,0.6065,0.29
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I think as you saw last year in the third quarter, Alex, there was -- that historical sort of pop that you get in -- from the DR business sort of got muted last year. And so while we would expect the number to be a little bit higher than you saw in the second quarter, you got to sort of -- you can't go back a couple years. You've got to sort of look at the sort of new trend there in terms of what you think that pop might be.",neutral,0.1495,0.059,0.7916
0,Operator,,And our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,neutral,0.0416,0.0264,0.932
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Mike, if you're talking, we can't hear you.",neutral,0.0278,0.2548,0.7174

Operator 
Okay. Mr. Carrier, did you want to ask your question? Okay. Hearing no response, we'll move on to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.",neutral,0.0378,0.0301,0.9321
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Just maybe focusing back on the balance sheet. On the asset side, I appreciate your comments, Mike, about you being -- you not moving up as much, but if you can talk about some of the drivers in the second quarter on the Fed funds and securities repo one. It looked like it was especially large increase, and it looked like there was also corresponding increase in the liability side there. What was the driver in that? And how should we think about that trend going forward?",neutral,0.1907,0.0747,0.7346
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I think you sort of need to -- and you'll probably notice there is -- if you're looking at the supplement, Brian. So there's a footnote on the page as well that I would sort of just point you to. But what happens in -- we've got a cleared repo product that gets some positive balance sheet treatment that gets -- where we'll do repos or reverse repos with clients that gets novated over to FICC. And so there's very little that ends up on the balance sheet. So that sort of makes the -- both the revenue and the rate sort of pop year-on-year, and you can get a sense based on the footnote on the bottom of the impact of that. So that's what you're seeing sort of drive that number -- or a good chunk of the driver of that number is that program really kicking in, and we've seen some good growth there.",neutral,0.1212,0.0239,0.8549
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"And would you expect that to stay pretty lively, I guess, with Fed hikes? Or does it look more sort of abnormal for at least this quarter?",neutral,0.045,0.2671,0.688
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"No. I think we've seen that -- we've seen the demand for that product ramp up over the last year. And so while in any given day or week, it sort of moved -- the volume moves around, we've seen that demand stay pretty consistent now over the last number of months.",positive,0.8731,0.039,0.0879
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"And then just as a follow-up. Maybe just as we look into 3Q and 4Q, if you can talk a little bit more about the impact to the clearing services run rate from the JPM transition that you mentioned at the end of the third quarter. So just trying to look through sort of a clean number there as we look into the fourth quarter. And then also, similarly from the 2 clients lost, I appreciate that you're going to be onboarding folks in the second half of next year. But is there more revenue runoff in the third quarter versus the second quarter, given those 2 clients running off?",neutral,0.1199,0.2462,0.6338
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. No, so I'll start with a second one first. So I think the impact of the lost clients is in the run rate now for the second quarter. So there's not another drop off in the Pershing business. So I think that's a pretty easy one. I think on the clearance and collateral, we haven't given you a specific number. But as we sort of think about those migrations, the -- we started with the smaller ones first and then you moved to the bigger ones over time. And so -- and by the end of the third quarter, we'll have pretty much everything in there. So I think once you get to a third quarter number, you'll have -- it will be pretty much fully in our run rate.",neutral,0.0745,0.1325,0.7931
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"So you're seeing a small piece this quarter, and you'll see a little bit more next quarter and then it will be in our run rate.",neutral,0.1454,0.0385,0.8161
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. And sorry, the only thing I'll add to your question though is when you sort of think about the clearing and collateral business, we're also seeing very good growth outside the U.S. So although we focus a lot on sort of the JPMorgan migrations here in the U.S., we've also got a very strong business outside the U.S., up -- very strong double-digit growth outside the U.S. in terms of the demand for that product that we've got.",positive,0.9052,0.0113,0.0835
0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Moving on to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0464,0.0204,0.9333
6,Brennan Hawken,,"I just had a follow-up on the deposit beta point. Looking at the 15 or so basis points increase in interest-bearing this quarter, but also then thinking about the fact that, I think you said that U.S. dollar deposits are about 70%, was there an increase in non-U.S. dollar deposit costs? Or should we apply that 15 basis point just to the U.S. dollar, which would suggest a beta higher. I'm just trying to square that component of the math, Mike. If you could help out on that, that'd be great.",neutral,0.2694,0.0275,0.7031
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. As you know, U.S. rate -- or non-U.S. rates have not really moved around that much in the quarter. Now there's some expectation that, that's going to start to happen in the third quarter, particularly in the U.K. at least, but that hasn't been a big driver so far. So and remember, as we've said, the betas are going to continue to sort of increase as rates increase. And so on the -- it sort of implies about a 60% beta for the quarter, and we would expect that to keep increasing as rates go up.",positive,0.7307,0.0271,0.2421
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Yes. It would apply 60% beta, but if we think about the U.S. dollar deposits, wouldn't it imply a higher beta in the U.S. -- on the U.S. side because -- since that's the only place we saw...",positive,0.4966,0.0315,0.4719
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, it would be a little higher.",neutral,0.4108,0.0206,0.5686
6,Brennan Hawken,,Okay. Good. Just wanted to clarify that. And then it sounds like noninterest-bearing shift you guys think is probably sustainable and in line with what you had expected. Do you think that we're going to be continuing the trend lower here in the foreseeable future? Or is there any sort of visibility that you have into that line as well and the sort of remixing that we would think is natural as rates go higher? That'd be great.,neutral,0.269,0.0348,0.6962
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, Brennan, so -- I mean, what we said a little earlier, right, is that the percentage -- the noninterest bearing as a percentage of the total is a little less than 30%, rounds, I think to 30% this quarter. That percentage we would expect to sort of grind down as rates rise. And so that may bounce around in a given quarter a little bit, but we would expect that to continue to grind down.",negative,0.0375,0.8697,0.0927
0,Operator,,We'll take our next question from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.,neutral,0.0414,0.0261,0.9325
9,Geoffrey Elliott,,"In terms of capital, you mentioned reviewing your models with some urgency. Once you've completed that, would you be thinking about putting in kind of mid-cycle resubmission as some of the other banks have done in the past to get the payout ratio back up without having to wait for next year's process?",neutral,0.2179,0.0166,0.7655
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. This is Charlie. I would say, I don't think we -- I think it's unclear. I think our first -- the first thing we've got to do is do the work on the modeling. And that is, it's got to be done properly, it's detailed, it's got to be reviewed, it's got to be signed off. And so we don't have a date at which that will be done, but the point is we're actively doing it. And then depending on when it's done and our conversations with the Fed, that will figure out where we go from there. So the short answer is we don't know.",neutral,0.042,0.0508,0.9072
9,Geoffrey Elliott,,"And then the real estate consolidation costs coming down from $100 million to $75 million, is that because you're able to do the same things at the lower cost than you originally expected? Or is it because you're doing a bit less or doing it over a longer time frame?",negative,0.0247,0.823,0.1523
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"No. It really relates to 1 building, and we actually sublet it. We know the actual numbers now.",neutral,0.0462,0.0261,0.9276
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.,neutral,0.0351,0.0338,0.9311
30,James Francis Mitchell,,"I noticed that on the period end balance sheet, deposits were down $10 billion, but the balance sheet was down $20 billion. Is there a deliberate effort to delever a little bit? Or is there something else going on in terms of the mismatch between the deposits shrinking and the balance sheet?",negative,0.0098,0.9519,0.0383
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. There's no effort to deleverage per se, Jim, as you would suggest. But as you start to look at treasury activity, some of the trades you would put on just make less sense now. And so we're just looking at how to best optimize sort of some of that. So I wouldn't read into that.",neutral,0.0463,0.0461,0.9076
30,James Francis Mitchell,,"Okay. And then maybe just with the rollback bill that passed that gave you guys a carve-out for the SLR, is that -- does that help at all? Or is that just the DFAST remains a constraint and it doesn't really matter in how you run your business?",neutral,0.0522,0.0276,0.9202
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I think -- well, I think the bills that are out -- the bill that got passed plus the -- some of the Fed proposals still have to get implemented. And so that'll take some time to sort of play into it. So in a BAU environment, the SLR is still something we're still focused on to make sure that we stay where we need to be. But as we sort of think about the future as constructed, the Tier 1 leverage ratio in CCAR is the place we're most focused on where our constraint is.",neutral,0.089,0.0304,0.8806
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"I guess, the only editorializing I would do around it is, I would describe it's certainly helpful because whenever you have something which you think makes less sense and you wind up with something which you think directionally makes more sense, that's a positive change in terms of recognition of the way the business should be run. But as Mike mentioned, our current constraint is the Tier 1 leverage ratio in CCAR, which quite frankly we struggle with in terms of a concept of constraint because of the reasons Mike spoke about. But we'll see where that one goes as well.",neutral,0.1383,0.0196,0.8421
0,Operator,,And our final question comes as a follow-up question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0516,0.0167,0.9316
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Just wanted to actually circle back more strategically on the balance sheet growth strategy. As rates go up, you guys have always thought deposits would sort of run off to some extent. But is there -- I mean, I guess, going forward, how do you view this from the client side of the business in terms of what you view as, let's say, the level of excess deposits that are subject to that potential runoff versus how you want to use deposit as an important product within your toolkit? And then if deposits do run off, would you be willing to use more borrowed funds to keep the balance sheet from shrinking significantly?",neutral,0.1026,0.1749,0.7224
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"So there's a bunch in there, Brian, so I'll try to get at it. But the -- so on the last piece, we're always looking for opportunities to deploy the balance sheet where it makes sense and where the return makes sense. So that's something we're looking at now and have always looked at and so -- and that'll sort of continue as we sort of think about that. And where we're focused on deposits is really growing the underlying franchise. So as Charlie sort of talked about a number of times now like where our focus is, is driving organic growth. And as you sort of do that across most of our products, particularly in Investment Services, that will bring deposits with it. And so as we sort of think about there may be some decline in some of the excess deposits, a lot of that sort of run off already, and you've got -- and as you sort of grow the franchise, you'll bring in new deposits as you do that.",neutral,0.1503,0.1663,0.6834
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,Right.  And can we frame what the level of excess deposits is right now roughly so we can get a sense of that?,neutral,0.0454,0.0374,0.9172
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,We have not disclosed that what we think that answer is.,neutral,0.0422,0.0296,0.9281
0,Operator,,And it looks like we do actually have another question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.,neutral,0.1453,0.0189,0.8359
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"If I can ask a question on core asset servicing. So ex securities lending, that line was down 1%, AUC/A were flattish. Can you just talk us through some of the dynamics, the pluses and minuses in the Asset Servicing on a sequential basis?",negative,0.0415,0.6443,0.3142
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. A lot of that, Ken, is just some seasonal-like activity that happens in the first quarter. We get some fees for things like tax reporting and then there are some other items that sort of hit -- only hit in the first quarter. So I wouldn't read into that as a run rate decline.",negative,0.0367,0.6635,0.2998
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. And then can you give us just some idea of your -- I know you've stopped giving us the new wins, but can you just give us an idea of the pipeline and how you're expecting that to kind of just traject over time as far as new wins in servicing?",neutral,0.0692,0.0181,0.9127
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. I would -- this is Charlie. I think we feel very good about what the wins were both on a gross basis and a net basis in the quarter. And I guess, the only other thing I would say is because with lots of people, you're right about the way the quarter pans out and whatnot, but you all know this, and we talked a little bit about this over the prior quarters. Wins take a period of time. These are generally conversations that happen over multiple quarters, leading up to a process generally if you're not going to renew with the incumbent. And so I think where we are today relative to where we hoped we would be, we're on target. And success for us in Asset Servicing will continue to be a slow, steady build, which quite frankly, it's hard to look at quarter-by-quarter, you need to look at it over a longer period of time. And I think at this point, we still feel on track relative to that commentary.",neutral,0.1201,0.0397,0.8402
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Fair point, Charlie. And if I might just 2 more cleanups just related to the numbers. Mike, did you say what the benefit on the revenue side was from FX translation on a year-over-year basis, if we put it into context with the 2% hurt on the cost side?",neutral,0.1225,0.0376,0.8399
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"We did. It was in my commentary. Roughly -- it was roughly about 1%.  Yes. It's like roughly -- but there, too, remember, we mentioned we also had some leasing gains and COLI/BOLI in the prior year. So my own take this net-net is -- the overall number is a pretty good -- I mean, the reported number is a pretty good proxy for what real growth was in the quarter. On the expense side, we did have the effect of currency and the real estate.",neutral,0.3452,0.0402,0.6146
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"And as we roll forward, that was my other question on the currency. The rate of growth on expenses, if we continue to have this burden on the cost side, is this kind of 3% zone the right way to think about go-forward as well?",neutral,0.0988,0.0211,0.8801
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I would go back to sort of the guidance we gave at Investor Day on expenses, Ken, and I think we're sort of tracking there.",neutral,0.0691,0.0246,0.9064
0,Operator,,And we have a question from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,neutral,0.0623,0.0217,0.9159
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Sorry about that earlier. Just one question on the Investment Management side. In terms of the long-term flows in the quarter, I don't know if you mentioned anything that was more unusual or maybe lumpy just given the level of outflows this quarter versus we haven't seen?",neutral,0.0654,0.2902,0.6444
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, so I'll take that and, Charlie, you can add color if you want. Just to remind you, Mike, we're very much an institutional money manager, very little retail in there. So you've got to think of that as you sort of look at some of these line items. I'll just reiterate the performance has been consistent. Charlie mentioned sort of the 89% over the 3 and 5-year benchmark. So we feel okay there. And as you sort of look at some of the more -- some of the equity -- actively managed equity portfolios, that's sort of in line with what you're seeing across the industry. On index, I would sort of think of some of those outflows as very idiosyncratic client -- changes in allocation for our clients. And then on the cash side, as I mentioned in my commentary, there was some concentration related to some big client M&A activity that brought some balances in on a temporary basis. So you sort of see that dynamic going through there.",neutral,0.1869,0.0705,0.7426
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Okay. That's helpful. And then I know you guys hit on Pershing just year-over-year some of the lost business. But just when I think about that business and some of the industry trends that we're seeing, generally, it's fairly favorable. But I just wanted to figure out like how much of that was just very specific to that versus maybe the core or the underlying trends of the business?",neutral,0.1038,0.0308,0.8653
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. Let me take a shot at this, I think these are -- so just as I talked about on the Asset Servicing side, where there are long gestation periods, when people decide to leave us, it's the same thing. So these are things that we've known about for a long time. It's factored into our thinking about what we think overall trends in revenue can look like. And again, these are relatively idiosyncratic relative to when they show up. There continues to be a significant interest in clients of all sizes to talk about their desire to figure out how -- what we can do at scale relative to not just cost, but building additional capabilities, how they can benefit from that. There is a -- I would describe this as an extremely open mind in the asset servicing world, where we deal with big asset managers and small asset managers across the world, but also, the broker-dealer community, both bigger and smaller. So I think relative to the way we think about the opportunity in the business, those trends continue to make us feel very good about the business that we have. And that's not even talking about the opportunities if -- within Pershing that we think we continue to have in the RIA space, which we highlighted at Investor Day.",neutral,0.1295,0.0162,0.8543
