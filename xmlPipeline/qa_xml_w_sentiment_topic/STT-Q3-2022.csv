0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,neutral,0.0492,0.017,0.9338
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"So maybe just a wrap-up question on BBH, and I appreciate all the transparency along the way. But regulators hate it, more complex, market values have fallen, I definitely went with you on the strategic merits. But I guess the question people have is, why not just walk away? It seems like you could do some really accretive stuff with the capital now and at what point do you just say, ""not worth it, not as accretive, too complex, enough said.""",negative,0.0443,0.6184,0.3373
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Glenn, it's Ron. Maybe needless to say, we go through that calculus that you're describing every day. And that's part of what's led to this. I mean, obviously, the regulatory environment is driving the time frame here, but what's driving our work is that trade-off. The trade-off between the opportunity to consolidate on a global basis, a very attractive firm versus what's the alternative uses of the capital, including returning it back to shareholders. 
We believe there's still the possibility that we can get this -- we can structure this transaction in a way that it will work both for shareholders and to achieve that strategic objective. But as we've said in the disclosure, the likelihood of that happening is going down. So I think what you can take away from this is one of the reasons that's driving that decrease probability is the calculus that you're describing.",neutral,0.1401,0.0255,0.8344
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Okay. Well, I guess we don't have to wait that much longer, so I can still have for another couple of months. Just one follow-up on -- I think you mentioned 60% of the securities portfolio has been moved into held to maturity. It shows in the smaller AOCI hits as rates go up. What's the other side of it? Like do you -- can you calculate what the NII give up or any other offsets to moving that large of a piece into held to maturity?",neutral,0.0595,0.024,0.9165
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Glenn, it's Eric. We've carefully considered what portion of the investment portfolio moved to held to maturity and what amounts. But what we do, as we make that consideration is the benefit is that you largely don't give up NII, right? By and large, you're earning the coupon and whether they're treasuries or agencies or MBS, just in a different accounting form and structure, but the earnings of the corporation are the same, and that's what's quite attractive about HTM. 
The reason why you wouldn't put the whole portfolio in HTM is partly you want some flexibility, you want to from time to time, rebalance the portfolio and you might want to rebalance 5, 10, 15 yards, and that takes an AFS construct under which to do it. And then partly, you want to make sure that you have -- you'll always have monetization at the front end to maximize and to maintain the liquidity construct you'd like. We've now put that in place. We can repo HTM securities in size. We test that in the marketplace, so we're quite comfortable. 
But there's a point where you say, look, I'd rather sit on cash or I'd rather sit on available and for sale. And so we feel like we're in a good balance now that really provides a real positive NII trajectory. And you see that, we've guided now to 28% to 30% up in NII this year. And I've also started to signal that we're positive on the NII trajectory in 2023 and partly because of the entire investment portfolio, whether it's an AFS or HTM is contributing to that upswing.",neutral,0.1813,0.0221,0.7966
0,Operator,,"And next, we'll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.",neutral,0.0393,0.0181,0.9426
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"I wanted to come back to putting the deal into context with the buyback that you announced, which you have been clearly saying you'd want to get back into the buyback this quarter. So could you just help us understand the $1 billion sizing and if that has anything to put in context with, your thoughts around how the pricing and eventual outcome if the deal goes through might end up coming through? Or is it completely separate and just based on where capital sits regardless of the deal outcome?",neutral,0.0362,0.0392,0.9245
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Ken, it's Eric. As I've said in my prepared remarks, the buyback was larger than anticipated. And part of that is we do two things. We look at our current capital levels, which have trended towards that 13% CET1 mark that we had guided to, remember that discussion we had in the first quarter. And then partly because -- partly as we consider the capital uses over the next couple of quarters, including the possibility of Brown Brothers Investment Services transaction. And you would expect us to factor in any adjustments downward adjustments to purchase price that we would expect, and that's effectively what we've done. So it's a mix of factors, but those are the components. 
And I think we're quite pleased. We can now proceed with $1 billion. As Ron said, we we're planning on comfortably returning more than 80% of earnings to shareholders next year, quarter by quarter by quarter, which is what our medium-term targets are. And that still availed us the capacity to do a deal at an admittedly adjusted price if it's appropriate at the time.",neutral,0.4213,0.0151,0.5637
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. And then on the denominator side, I guess, of capital, can you just give us a little color on how you'd expect deposits to traject from here, a pretty meaningful decline in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing, just relative to where you're ending here, just your general outlook on your thoughts around deposit mix and flows.",negative,0.0293,0.8721,0.0986
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I think our deposit trends will probably be in line with some of what you're seeing in the industry. I think we're within that zone of if you look at the Fed reports, if you look at other institutions, and we've certainly begun to see that rotation out of deposits this quarter, down about 5%, both year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter adjusted for currency translation. 
I think what we have seen over the last year is a series of factors that have impacted it. And this is my way to say that I can give you some guidance, but it's going to vary depending on how the factors play out. So you have U.S. dollar appreciation, and so you have a -- nondollar deposits are -- come down as a result. 
We have equity markets falling, which means the AUC/As that we custody for are coming down. And with that, investors, institutions, retail hold similarly lower cash amounts. And so part of what's happening here is the environment is actually affecting deposits somewhat independently of where we are in the rate -- with rising rates and quantitative tightening. 
Now we are seeing the effects of rising rates and quantitative tightening as well. So I kind of give you that as a background because I think there are 4 or 5 factors at play here, which is more than expected. I think as we look forward, we continue to expect some deposit outflows in the fourth quarter. We expect those to be somewhat less than we saw in the third quarter, but we do expect some, and those are factored into our NII guide. And one of the reasons why we have a wider NII guide than usual is because there's a range of outcomes. 
But we're seeing what we expected. We're seeing what we expected as we -- as rates are up, and we price carefully and maintain, I think, some healthy betas this quarter. we're seeing noninterest-bearing begin to flow out because with the higher rates, both in the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. in particular, you have the difference that clients can earn. 
And then one of the things we're doing with our clients is to be -- is to think about the full range of offerings for them. Sometimes it's the base account, sometimes it's special accounts with deposits. We -- if you remember, we've historically put in place deposit initiatives to have the right balance of deposits on the balance sheet. And then the other thing that this is feeding in some of our other businesses, whether it's the cash business in GA, whether it's the repo business. There's a whole set of product offerings that are that cash flows to that we're pleased to support our clients with. 
So there's quite a bit going on in this area, more to come, but we're comfortable with some of these forecasts. And what I find particularly important to keep in mind is NII continues to rise even with some of these deposit outflows. And part of that is the U.S. rates that we're also familiar with. But given that so much of our balance sheet is international, those foreign rate rises are particularly helpful and those deposits are at good levels as well.",negative,0.0951,0.5308,0.3741
0,Operator,,"Next, we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.",neutral,0.034,0.0218,0.9442
4,Alexander Blostein,,"I was hoping we could speak a little bit more broadly around State Street's capital allocation strategy. If BBH does not go through, what's your appetite for any other deals, whether it's in the services space or asset management space? Obviously, macro conditions are pretty volatile. So I'm sure that will impact that as well. But curious how you're thinking about the trade-off between accelerating buyback or other deals. And then if you do go down the path of more buybacks, should we be thinking about the upper end of your CET1 and leverage as sort of the target to which you will go to or you might need to run with a buffer sort of on top of that given uncertain macro conditions?",neutral,0.0636,0.0325,0.904
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. Alex, why don't I begin on this just on how we think about M&A. It's not like we have a shopping list here. BBH is a unique opportunity to consolidate the market on a global basis. And by that, I mean it's not just about adding to some particular geography, but it really does bolster us in all the major geographies that we're in. Having said that, we've got our own what we believe is a distinctive organic strategy in the servicing area, led by our Alpha proposition, which continues to grow. 
There's a lot of development that was being completed this year and early next year, which will lead to a lot of new onboardings and we think even make the proposition attractive to a broader set of clients. So we always are looking in the marketplace to see if there's something that makes sense, but it's not like the money is burning a hole in our pocket. And if this doesn't work, we're immediately going to go out and come back with something else. Eric, you may want to talk just about how we think about the context of buybacks.",neutral,0.2812,0.0097,0.7091
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. And Alex, I think I'd add that we're quite conscious that we raised almost $2 billion of equity from our investors and diluted them. We certainly expect that -- if the deal doesn't proceed, that the bulk of our excess capital needs to go back to shareholders. That's deserved and I think expected, and we would deliver on that. I think in terms of capital ratios, I had said earlier this year when the economic environment felt more benign and when we had simplified and attenuated a lot of the OCI risk in the investment portfolio that we might be willing to go down to the lower end and even below the lower end of our 10% to 11% range. 
I think now given the economic uncertainties, we, for the time being, expect to operate in the -- towards the middle of that range, that might change over time. But for now, I think our current expectation is we have reduced the volatility in the investment portfolio, which reduces on one hand, the need for a capital buffer to some extent. On the other hand, the economic environment is much more -- has much more volatility in it, and that pushes us in the other direction. But the net of that is that I think we're quite comfortable with the 10% to 11% range and operating somewhere in the middle there.",positive,0.5361,0.1097,0.3542
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Great. That's helpful. My follow-up question may be around the business side of things. You guys have a very sizable pipeline of installations on the servicing side. A lot of them are Alpha mandates, which obviously tend to be a little bit more complex. You talked to us, I think, on the last call sort of the cadence of how that's going to come through on the revenue side. But I'm just kind of curious how you would contextualize any incremental investments or expenses that will need to come with it given sort of complexity of those installations over the next 12 to 18 months.",neutral,0.0682,0.022,0.9098
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes, I'll start, Alex, on the investments. And Eric can talk you through the pattern. On the investments, there is actually ongoing development, as I mentioned earlier. And that development, much of -- some of which is being completed this year, some of which is being completed next year. But it's all part of our medium-term plan as well as our budget. So there's nothing out of the ordinary that you should expect to do this. 
And in fact, much of the development is behind us or will be behind us at year-end. These -- within the $3.4 trillion, as you would expect, it's the larger, more complex Alpha mandates in some cases, they're development partners with us where we're developing new features and functionality, which will be available not just to that particular client, but more broadly to the client base. So these are important things to get done, important things to get done right, and we think are a good use of our investment dollars because they'll result not just in being able to onboard that client, but to be able to broaden the offering.",neutral,0.1955,0.0101,0.7944
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"And then, Alex, I'd add that we certainly need to plan and begin to set up onboarding teams. Those are well underway. And so you saw a head count tick up this quarter for example. Expenses, though, were well controlled. The headcount was in our hubs in some of the lower-cost markets purposely, so we're navigating through that. But some of the expenses have to be put on in advance of -- as we're doing the onboarding in advance of the installation and the recognition of revenue and some come as the revenue comes on. 
But I think, as Ron said, all this is within our expense guidance. It will be within our expense guidance when we get to that in January for next year. And our view is that we collectively need to continue to drive margins in the right direction given our medium-term targets. That needs to be a mix of both the revenue lift we're getting from Alpha deals as well as the expense and productivity initiatives, both within the Alpha environment and across the traditional franchise. And all that has to come together to deliver on our financial commitments.",neutral,0.1938,0.0172,0.7889
0,Operator,,"Next, we'll go to Brennan Hawken with UBS.",neutral,0.0382,0.0189,0.943
6,Brennan Hawken,,"I'd like to ask on BBH. It seems somewhat unusual to be getting regulatory approval before the approvals within the company. So why is that happening? And given that there's risk of deterioration, loss of talent, customers, Ron, you made reference to this during the last quarter call when you guys first said you were renegotiating. Would you have the ability to adjust price further if this process drags? And -- or has that been set already?",neutral,0.0357,0.2531,0.7112
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"On the approvals, our Board has been actively involved in this, Brennan, as has the BBH partners on their side throughout this process. So obviously, there was an approval before we announced this and in September of '21, there's an ongoing consultation with our Board, and we've walked them through modifications. But we don't have a final deal yet, largely because we have not actually gotten through the regulatory process and figured out what the actual structure would be that will satisfy all of the regulators. So it's not completely binary and that we're not talking to our Board until it's all done. But obviously, our Board needs to see the entire thing in total and be able to make that decision. 
In terms of the ongoing kind of risk to clients and people, that's there. It continues. We are spending a lot of time with clients, as I think I've mentioned before, about half the client base is a shared client base. So these are clients that we talk to anyway. I think there's still a strong desire on the part of our clients that if this can be completed in a way that makes sense, they'd like to see it completed. So I do not worry about further client attrition. 
We obviously are worried about people attrition on both sides, but largely on the BBH side, and we're monitoring that closely. And to the extent to which we felt like after the price reduction we've already negotiated that circumstances have changed sufficiently further that we needed that again, of course, we would raise up if we needed to do that.",neutral,0.1322,0.0369,0.8309
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. And then second question is maybe a bit -- well, I will just come right out. So why is this so strategically compelling? I mean it seemed as though it was largely a scale deal, now it's deteriorated. You said earlier, Ron, that the accretion is probably going to be more drawn out and it's going to be lower than initially planned. It's more complicated, so you're introducing a lot of operational and legal complexity. I get it, you're lowering the price, but is this really a good use of time? Is this really a good use of management focus? Why not just understand that the environment deteriorated, the regulatory approvals didn't come through, it couldn't work as constructed, and so it's better off just to walk.",neutral,0.0926,0.3289,0.5785
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"I mean, again, I'm probably repeating myself a little bit, Brennan, here, but that's exactly what we ask ourselves every day. And you're right, it is taking a lot of management time. I think what's compelling about it is several things. One is its footprint. Many of the things that are out there or supposedly out there are rumored to be out there tend to be single geography kinds of things. And if you have a strong desire to be in that geography, maybe it is something useful, but there I would describe as at best, tactical. This one is -- adds scale to us everywhere where we are, and it really does set it apart from the others. 
Secondly, it's got some technology assets that we like. We've talked about those in the past. Third, it's got a set of people and professionals that we believe are equal to and sometimes even better than some of our people, and that's attractive to us. But that has to be weighed against all the factors that you and others have raised here, and we continue to do that, which is why we're not coming here saying to you, ""yes, this is -- we're ready to go. We're not ready to go."" It's also why we're coming here saying to you that we recognize this has gone on long enough, and that we need to bring this to a close this quarter.",neutral,0.0942,0.0248,0.881
0,Operator,,"Next, we'll go to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.",neutral,0.0343,0.0265,0.9392
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"So I wanted to ask one clarifying question on NII. Some of your bank peers, they've indicated 4Q exit rate could be close to the peak this cycle just as lag deposit pricing begins to catch up with rate hikes. You noted that the '23 NII, Eric, will be up nicely year-on-year, but do you see the potential for '23 NII coming in above that annualized 4Q level, suggesting that, that fourth quarter NII guidance is not going to be representative of the peak?",positive,0.4562,0.0886,0.4552
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"I think you're trying to get deeply into our 2023 forecast, and I think it's a little premature to do that. I mean, to be honest, let's see how deposits flow and evolve this coming quarter. Let's see whether the U.S. Central Bank and the foreign central banks continue to have the wherewithal to tame inflation because that's important, right? Or are they going to or not? So it's quite dependent upon all that. 
I think the reason I made my positive statements about 2023 is that we don't see fourth quarter as the quarterly peak. We think there's more of that more NII upside over subsequent quarters. We also have a balance sheet that has a mix of USD and non-USD and in some cases, we tend to have more foreign deposits. And those are areas if those foreign central banks continue to hike and address the serious inflationary environments in their geographies that give us an additional tailwind that may be different than a U.S. bank. 
So there's certainly momentum here. I don't want to get into fourth quarter annualized versus my current view of 2023, but I did say good continuing growth purposely. I think there's more to come on NII. But I think we'll know more in a quarter or two, to be honest, but we see a trajectory that is good and reasonably positive given what we know in the environment today.",neutral,0.3076,0.0591,0.6333
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"So reading the tea leaves, I may scrap my question on the expense growth algorithm and what that implies for next year. But the one area I did want to unpack on expense is the margins in the investment management segment, they're down about 600 basis points year-on-year. That's an area where you made significant progress over the last couple of years. Certainly, you're going to see some pressures given the declining market, but wanted to get a sense as to how much expense flexibility you have there? And where you think you can actually hold the line on the pretax margin for that particular business?",negative,0.0162,0.9266,0.0572
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"I think I'd start answering that question by saying we're actually quite pleased by the progress we've made in growth and margins in the Investment Management business over, call it, the last 3 years. I think it had teens level margins, if you go back in time, that we got into the 20s. 
Some of that was the market uptick, which flowed through the management fee line. Some of it was a, I think, delivering strongly on flows and net new revenues was positive across the franchise. Cash as an example, continues to be a standout, but each of the three franchises have new products and offerings have been quite good. 
And I think what the team has done there well is as they have secured those flows, launched those new products, they've also managed the expense base. And so just because it was a tailwind from equity markets or fixed income markets or from flows, they've actually kept expenses remarkably flat in that environment or flattish in that environment, which I think is a testament to how they've navigated the environment. 
I think what you should expect is that a couple of things. If equity markets continue to operate at this level, we need to continue to work on expenses and productivity becomes an even bigger focus there as it should be across the company. I think on the flip side of that, if we get some kind of rebound in equity and fixed income markets, that plays through the asset management business financials, I would expect expenses to continue to be disciplined there and margins to certainly go back to some of the higher levels that you saw. 
But I would say, I think at 31% margins, we're quite pleased with where we are. And I think there is -- depend where equity markets go, I think the trajectory will continue in a generally positive direction.",positive,0.7416,0.0268,0.2317
0,Operator,,"Next, we'll go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.",neutral,0.0358,0.0208,0.9435
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Just one quick cleanup on BBH. Can you close that deal, if it all works well? Can you close that on December 31 or earlier and buyback the $1 billion? And do you need to have that Tier 1 leverage ratio be within or above your target range? In other words, can you do this and be at, say, the low end of the target range just temporarily for 4Q or even below?",neutral,0.0912,0.024,0.8848
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brian, it's Eric. I think the timing of this deal is quite uncertain given where we are. We've not been able to complete the regulatory process and there's still -- so I think -- thinking about this in months as opposed to quarters is premature. We've done the buyback calculation though fully considering the reduced price that is -- that would be part of Brown Brothers transaction. 
And so whether the timing is quarter x or quarter y, we're comfortable proceeding with $1 billion. We're pleased to get it started in the coming days. And regardless how that plays out, be able to return, as I said, and as Ron said, comfortably more than the 80% that we've committed to throughout next year at a minimum.",neutral,0.3018,0.018,0.6802
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Great. That's great. And then just one on the deposit betas. Maybe if you can just talk about how you see them right now as they exist in terms of like how you're defining them for both the U.S. versus the non-U.S. And then as we move into next year, maybe sort of an outlook without giving NII guidance, of course, but just sort of a range of where you think the terminal betas could be in the U.S. versus the non-U.S. even if it's a fairly wide range.",neutral,0.0576,0.0213,0.9211
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Let me describe it this way. And let me cover U.S. and non-U.S. to -- because both matter in a positive way for our books. I think the betas this quarter in the U.S. were in the 55% range. We're pleased to see that. Those are up from about 35% last quarter, but exactly where you'd expect us to be where we expected to be, given the uptick in rates. Next quarter, if we go from 55% this quarter to 65% beta the next quarter, we'd be quite comfortable. And then it just continues to inch up. That's just how it plays through. 
In euros, we're also in that 50% range as we've started to cross into positive territory for central banks, and we expect that to continue. So part of the reason for the NII forecast into fourth quarter and into next year is that we expect betas in the 50% to 60% range in euros. The market operates a little differently than the U.S., but that would be in the range. 
And then in pound sterling, betas are lower, they tend to be in the 30% to 35% range there. and then you can keep going, Aussie dollars, Canadian dollars and so forth. And we have a balance sheet that is prepared for rate rises across those currencies as well. And then you'll just see betas notch up quarter-over-quarter. I think at the terminal level, there's always some amount of lagging that you do. That's just how it happens. You never get to 100% beta or anything near that because you have some noninterest-bearing and you have some lag deposits, but we'll see. We're comfortable where we are in the 50% range going to 60%, and I think it will -- I think it will play out well for the NII and the balance sheet accordingly.",neutral,0.3069,0.0324,0.6607
0,Operator,,"Next, we'll go to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.",neutral,0.0341,0.0218,0.9441
49,James Francis Mitchell,,"Eric, maybe just one last question on NII, and I apologize. But as we think about big picture, Fed funds being potentially 200 basis points or more higher than 2018, European rates being positive versus negative back then. Do you see anything conceptually to suggest you should -- your NIM shouldn't be higher than back then? Or just wanted to get your thoughts on that.",neutral,0.0893,0.0592,0.8515
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Jim, it's Eric. I'm a little more focused on NII than on NIM. And the reason we've done that is because we've actually changed the shape of our balance sheet over time. I mean, remember, we added some deposit initiatives, which tend to be at lower NIMs, but they are NII-accretive and positive. And we do that because sometimes we want to balance currencies around the balance sheet. We want to raise deposits where we want to land. We need to keep deposits for intraday. There are lots of reasons why we have a different mix of the balance sheet. And we've done that purposely in an engaging way with our clients over the last 2, 3 years. 
So I don't think as a result, the balance sheet is bigger. And part of the reason we've been -- we've allowed it to be bigger is that the leverage ratio is not particularly constraining on us. And so what our intentionality is actually to maximize NII as opposed to NIM. So I think as you play that out, I think our NIMs are lower at this point than they were last time in the cycle. And I think they will -- they'll likely be below the -- the NIMs will be below the highs of the last cycle. 
On the other hand, I think if you calculate the forecast we've given you for NII for fourth quarter, so the next quarter that we're about to print, that will be a new high of NII relative to what we had seen in the last cycle. And so -- and that's where we're a little more focused because that's what comes back to shareholders and what creates earnings and earnings momentum that contributes to the bottom line.",neutral,0.1812,0.1253,0.6935
49,James Francis Mitchell,,Okay. Fair enough. And just maybe on the BlackRock ETF transition. How much is left? And do you see that as a material -- any kind of a material impact on forward revenues?,neutral,0.0469,0.1409,0.8122
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"We've our guidance has been pretty consistent on this. We -- and I think you'll find it in our 10-Qs and Ks that we estimate that the revenue outflow is about 2 percentage points of fees. So that hasn't changed. You saw some of that begin to come out this quarter. That was worth about $5 million this quarter. If you kind of get to the full quarter amount, it will be just under $10 million for fourth quarter, and that was worth about $1 trillion of AUC/A. So that did occur, and we'll continue to keep you updated on that. 
But as we've previously disclosed and talked about, deconversions just take time. And it'll play out sometime towards the second half of 2023 and then into 2024 will probably be the majority of it. But we'll just see. We're working closely with our -- with BlackRock. We continue to be quite pleased with all the existing business we do with them and the work we do for them in the alternative servicing area, which we're one of the largest providers and certainly help them as they want to evolve, diversify and support their plans.",neutral,0.3768,0.0126,0.6106
0,Operator,,"Next, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.",neutral,0.0324,0.02,0.9476
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Eric, can you remind us, you talked a little bit about it in your prepared remarks about fee revenues, the pricing pressure that you see every year. Can you remind us if that number has changed a bit at all? And second, as part of that, I think you've also indicated in the past, you needed a certain amount of assets under custody to neutralize that pressure. And I don't remember, I think it was $1.3 billion, but I could be wrong of new business wins to neutralize that downward pricing pressure.",neutral,0.1022,0.1428,0.755
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Gerard, let me start that, and it is an area that we continue to work on. The pricing headwinds are just a condition of our industry. Why? Because as you remember, pricing is AUM or a AUC/A based, and so as equity markets go up, clients expect some of that to come back to them. The pricing headwinds on an aggregate basis in the servicing fee line are about 2 percentage points of headwinds a year. And while we saw that bubble in 2017, '18, '19, that's come back down, that ticked up and then it's been well managed back down to that 2% or so level. And that's what we are seeing today. We're not seeing anything different than that, and it's well within our expectations. 
In terms of wins, we always want to focus on net new business and for net new business to drive a positive impact on the revenues as they did this quarter. I was clear in my prepared remarks that net new business was positive. We had some nice wins. We actually had some nice wins and nice fee rates, right, because both matter to your point. The benchmark I've put out there is that we expect about $1.5 trillion of AUC/A wins a year to be in a good positive direction and trajectory for net new business. 
But to be honest, as the CFO, I would like to see a little more and you've seen last year was particularly strong. This year, year-to-date, I think we're comfortably -- we're already comfortably at that level, and we still have another quarter to go. So the sales momentum continues. And what I find important is it continues to cross both our traditional cost and accounting business and our Alpha offerings, and so it's been broad-based.",neutral,0.382,0.0954,0.5226
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Gerard, what I would add is on the topic of pricing. We mentioned to you at the end of the second quarter that we launched a targeted repricing initiative. That is well underway, and it's focused on the areas of high value or where costs are increasing higher than in other places, and that is intended to -- is to achieve margin preservation. In other words, to offset the cost of delivering something high value or to offset the increasing costs in areas, for example, where we have disproportionate market data and things like that. So that initiative is well underway. When we talked to you last time, it just launched, so we were in the dozens of clients. Now we're in conversations with a triple-digit number, so we're pleased with that progress, too.",neutral,0.4194,0.0127,0.5678
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"And has it been well received or understood, I should say, nobody likes price increases? But are the clients' understanding of why this conversation has to take place?",neutral,0.0605,0.0421,0.8974
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. I think understood is the right word, Gerard. I think that these are sophisticated institutions themselves. They see what's going on. So I think it's been, for the most part, understood.",neutral,0.0952,0.0256,0.8792
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Very good. And then, Eric, as a follow-up, can you remind us what percentage of assets under custody or under management are variable rate-priced products, meaning your customers pay basis points on the assets under custody, and so therefore, to your point, when the value goes up and down, obviously, it affects revenues?",neutral,0.0621,0.1719,0.7661
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. It's a bit of a mix across different segments and across geographies. But a good rule of thumb is 50%, 55% are asset under custody based, so move up and down with market. There's another 20% that -- of the pricing tends to be based on transactional activity, and we actually saw transactions volumes, DTCC trades, wire transfers, derivatives, transactions and so forth come down this quarter. And then the last 20%, 25% tend to be relatively fixed or sometimes semi-fixed, the number of funds you custody for or some flat fees.",neutral,0.029,0.3742,0.5969
0,Operator,,"Okay. Next, we'll go to Mike Brown with KBW.",neutral,0.0389,0.0226,0.9385
25,Michael C. Brown,,"I guess on BBH, I suppose it's been a while since we've gotten a financial update on the business and how it's performed in this volatile environment year-to-date. And clearly, there's a possibility that we have a resolution that could end up moving forward with the acquisition. So as we think about our models here and getting those kind of aligned with how BBH is performing, anything you can share on how the company has performed year-to-date?",neutral,0.1636,0.0143,0.8221
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, we're obviously monitoring the business performance closely, monthly, quarterly. And I think it's -- you should expect -- you can go back to some of the materials that we had shared a year ago, September, as the base case. But you could take that, Mike, and extrapolate some of what you've seen in our book of business, right? We're an asset management-oriented custodian. 
You can even look at some of our peers with as benchmark. And I think you'd find what we've seen, which is that there's a sharp boost in NII, in their book or NII plus fees because of the mix of programs that they run for their clients' cash, offset -- partially offset, I'd say, with some downdraft in servicing fee rates, equity in bond markets. And then you'd see a bit of uptick on the FX services kind of business. 
So I think it's ours and other large custodians are a parallel to what you've seen. And so it's something we're considering. But as we talked about earlier, we're conscious that it's -- that we need to think about this from a couple of different perspectives. But it's performing in line with what we and you would expect at this point.",neutral,0.2162,0.022,0.7618
25,Michael C. Brown,,"Okay. Understood, Eric. Maybe just one last cleanup one for me. How should we think about how the unrealized losses on the AFS portfolio could -- should accrete back over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months as we think about your capital ratio or how that will impact the capital ratios over that time period?",neutral,0.0305,0.0849,0.8846
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. It is part of our capital forecasting now. So -- and it was actually included in some of the buyback and capital return estimates that we provided not only for the fourth quarter, but also for our intentions related to next year. I think this quarter, the accretion was worth $60 million or so of capital, and that's just the reversal of those, of that mark accreting back as the bonds mature. There tends to be a little lumpiness to it, but that's the start of the accretion. 
And so it did provide some amount of modest tailwind, and we'll certainly factor that in, right? Because just like earnings create an opportunity to return capital to shareholders, the accretion does as well, and that will be part of -- that builder capital ratios, which then we can share back with shareholders.",neutral,0.1389,0.022,0.8391

18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"Just to clarify. So in the next 10 weeks, we should either expect you to say that you'll proceed with the BBH deal or that you won't be proceeding and maybe there'll be an extra $2 billion buyback. Am I interpreting that correctly?",neutral,0.1054,0.0317,0.8629
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"What you should take away from what we've said, Mike, is that by the end of this quarter, we will have a decision on whether to proceed forward or not to proceed forward. On the buyback, first, we need a Board authorization for further buyback and we'll communicate what we're intending on buybacks after that authorization.",neutral,0.0579,0.0261,0.916
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"Okay. And just I know that the first question of this call was why don't just walk away and that's been the topic. Let me just take the flip side, just I'm sure you've invested a lot of resources and time and thought into this. Is the real issue, just the regulators? And I'm just wondering, it's like roughly what, like 10% of your size, other G-SIFIs either 10x to 15x larger. 
I mean, when I worked at the Fed 30 years ago, it all must be considered de minimis, right? I mean it's -- and I'm just trying to figure out the change. We all know the change in mindset as it relates to mergers generally. But I'm just wondering, does this put you at a permanent strategic penalty box that you can't pursue any mergers. Or is it something unique to this deal? Now I know you can't talk in particular about this deal in general, but can you make any broader statements like when G-SIFIs do this or G-SIFIs do that, it gets extra scrutiny or it's not as easy to get through anymore?",neutral,0.0355,0.05,0.9144
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes, Mike, what I would say is that the timing of our announcement in this deal in retrospect, probably couldn't have come at a worst time because if you think about the regulatory agencies, many of them, to some extent, were going through some kind of personnel change. So that itself has slowed things down. In some cases, it's driven a very significant change in philosophy. 
Whether that change in philosophy will be permanent or not, I don't know. I'd like to think not. But to answer, I think the number of your question is, did anything change for us beyond the regulatory situation? The answer is no. I mean we have -- for all the reasons that we've stated to you going back to September of last year, we feel like the deal is strategically compelling. 
In terms of longer term, what does this mean for our position. I mean, again, that's something that we think about, and that's something that we certainly have conversations about with our primary regulator. And I think there's some sympathy to all that. But I don't want to talk about something in the abstract beyond the transaction that we're in, which is the BBH deal. It's not all regulators. It's a subset, and it's a situation that we're going to work our way through, but work our way through very cognizant of what it means for our shareholders, what it means for clients, et cetera.",neutral,0.0633,0.1046,0.8321
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,And then last follow-up on this. Is there anything that you can do to help control the outcome at this time? Or is it simply based on the analysis by the regulators?,neutral,0.0372,0.0243,0.9385
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Well, that -- I mean, we've talked about modifications to the transaction and the modifications are meant to meet either regulatory concern or to navigate or to do what we believe is required to navigate through regulatory concerns. So that's what we're up to now.",neutral,0.0883,0.019,0.8927

5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I know you've had some M&I charges, merger and integration charges over the past few quarters. I mean if any of that is for the BBH deal, was there anything in a walkaway that you would be refunded for? I'm guessing the answer is no, but I just want to make sure I understand how that works.",neutral,0.0781,0.039,0.8829
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Betsy, it's Eric. No, those are incurred charges that are about primarily our staffing and then some of the service providers. But we've also -- what we have done is avoided some of the -- obviously, there are costs that are continuing on deal closing, some of the advisory fees, et cetera, those have not played through there, and those would not be incurred. So those are kind of the base level expenses. And there's no tail on those by and large.",negative,0.044,0.4928,0.4632

5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then we've had 2 quarters of very strong dollar performance here, dollar strengthening Q-on-Q. And I just -- I see it in the deck, the ins and outs on, the drag on revenues, the benefit to expenses, a little bit of a drag on the AUC, AUM volumes, you've got some benefit from volatility in the trading line. So I just wanted to get your sense of how has the dollar strengthening all in impacted you? And how do you think about managing, just generally speaking?",neutral,0.1621,0.0425,0.7954
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Betsy, it's Eric. What I described to you is that the dollar has an effect as do all the currencies on our P&L and balance sheet, but it's relatively symmetric and, I'll say, almost neutral. And I say that in EBIT terms and in balance sheet terms, it -- dollar strengthening reduces revenues but also reduces the expenses, not in all currencies and all the time, but it tends to have almost an EBIT-neutral impact on the P&L. 
And then on the balance sheet, you also have a similar effect whereas deposits are revalued downwards in foreign jurisdictions as U.S. appreciates, so are the assets in those jurisdictions, and so you have some symmetry. So by and large, it's, I'll call it, roughly neutral, which is why we don't do any particular hedging on it because we find that we can manage through it in a comfortable manner except that it makes our reporting to all of you in the analyst and investment community a little more complicated, but that's just what needs to happen.",neutral,0.112,0.0604,0.8276

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Betsy, it's Ron. Let me take that. I would say that we've got a good geographic mix now. And so the way we think about it in virtually all of our locations, it's not like we're not at minimum efficient scale, but to the extent to which we can achieve more scale there, we'd like that. I think in general, the non-U.S. markets have continued in most circumstances, not all, to grow faster than U.S. markets on balance.

Given that you've talked about buying back $1 billion of stock, the deal value was $3.5 billion, that's a pretty substantial percentage.

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. I suppose that's something we could explore, Vivek. It's -- then the attraction goes down even more.

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. So I would say, again, this has been highly targeted, Vivek, so it's not like we've said, there's an x percent across the board kind of thing. We've really tied it to, one, where our costs are under the most pressure; and two, where there's high-value added delivered to the client. And so I think you should interpret understood as we understand why you're asking for this. There's certainly some talk around it and is that the right number, et cetera.
