17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Thanks, Gerard.",positive,0.657,0.0224,0.3206
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"Can you give us a big picture answer? Obviously, you guys are one of the chief plumbers of the financial system. And we saw, as you pointed out, extraordinary volumes in so many different areas. Can you give us a read from the inside how the system handled all the surge? It appears to have ended it well, but maybe you can give us some firsthand examples of how well the macro system worked to the surge in activity?",neutral,0.2323,0.0285,0.7391
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I'll take that, Gerard. So it's Todd. I think it was impressive how well the system did handle the huge increases in activity. I mean, there were a couple of glitches, but not many. And for example, in our Clearing and Collateral Management business, we went to 100% work from home very early on. And all of that worked quite smoothly. And so we saw volumes increased 50% overnight. But we had the technology and the capacity to manage it. So I think I'm pretty impressed across the board where we saw resiliency and disaster recovery plans. That had to change a bit, too, because typically, a disaster recovery plan would be focused on a region, but this was obviously global. And so the move to work from home was wherever it could be executed was executed. So a couple of occasional glitches, constant conversations between the clearing counterparties as well as our clients. We had many thousands of conversations to make sure that we were connected and that they knew how they could connect with us. We -- there was a lot of mobilization to the use of our portal and electronic means of communication, which made things much simpler. So I mean -- I think it was an impressive reflection of the strength of our financial system and the infrastructure of it.",neutral,0.2779,0.0318,0.6902
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"And then a more specific question. Obviously, CECL hit your provision for the quarter, similar to other banks. Two parts. First, what kind of economic assumptions were used to come up with that provision that you put into the first quarter results? And then second, if you could identify where most of that was allocated, was it to, you mentioned some hotel exposure or to financial customers would be helpful as well.",neutral,0.0561,0.0235,0.9204
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Mike, do you want to take that one?",neutral,0.0421,0.0312,0.9268
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Yes, sure. Gerard, I'll take that. So I'd say, first, as you sort of think about the reserve that we built, a very small piece of it was due to individual either borrower downgrades or the incremental loans that we saw drawn. And most of it was really reflective of the changing economic environment and the new accounting standard. And as we sort of think about the outlook that was in there, the outlook takes into account multiple scenarios, and we sort of use that changing environment to sort of inform what we did and as you sort of look at it, it was a meaningful waiting towards a very -- a prolonged recessionary scenario that doesn't fully recover until you get into 2021. So I think that's the way I would sort of think about it.",neutral,0.0526,0.106,0.8414

6,Brennan Hawken,,"Sorry, it's another earnings call that's overlapping, but I've got to have to do myself from here. Apologies. First off, Todd, congratulations on getting the role of CEO. They kept us in suspense for a while, but glad to see we got to the right choice. Quick one on deposit cost trends. So they came in better than expected. It was probably helped by some of the timing of deposit growth. But is there a way you could help us think about that line in 2Q? Maybe how much was averaging? And then what you expect to continue to see as far as some relief on the deposit cost front would be great.",positive,0.6737,0.0158,0.3105
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Mike, you want to take that one as well? And thanks, Brennan.",positive,0.588,0.0133,0.3987
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Sorry about that. Yes. So Brennan, as you sort of think about it. So as you know, the Fed moved pretty substantially in the latter -- or the middle of March, I guess. And we adjusted our pricing there. And so you only saw really a couple of weeks of that sort of embedded in the first quarter averages. And so as you sort of look at the full run rate impact of that, it's going to be a pretty substantial increase down for the cost of interest-bearing deposits. And so in the beta, obviously changes, as you sort of get close to 0, but I think you'll see a pretty significant decline as you get down for the rest of the quarter.",negative,0.0582,0.8607,0.0812
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. All right. And then when we think about the servicing lines, I believe, Mike, that you talked about how there was some strength from volumes which aided the line, which you guys flagged during 1Q as well in early March, and it was great to see it come through. But it seemed as though you sort of cautioned about that sustaining. Is that because you have seen some of those volumes already subside? And can you help us think about maybe how much of a contributing factor that was so we could maybe calibrate for how to adjust in our forecast?",neutral,0.2792,0.0653,0.6555
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"So Mike, you want to start, and maybe I'll add a little color.",neutral,0.088,0.0198,0.8923
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Look, I think if you sort of think about what we saw, as Todd mentioned in his script, Brennan, is, is the volumes we saw in the latter part of March were exceptional. And they went from -- for lack of a better way to describe it, sort of 0 to 100 overnight. And as we sort of look at what we're seeing post quarter end, the volumes are still higher than they were before the surge, but certainly off the peaks that we had in the latter part of March. And I think as you sort of look at the go-forward expectation, it's really hard to predict with a high degree of certainty, how long they'll stay elevated and come down back to normal.",neutral,0.4003,0.1518,0.4479
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Yes. I'd add a little color. I mean, in some of the businesses like clearing and collateral management, so if you think about our government clearing business, that's continuing to sustain itself at a very high level because the government is issuing a lot of debt, and there's a lot of trading going on around that. The collateral management business is probably a little bit off from where we saw it at the peak. But I think secured lending will become more and more -- it will continue to be important in the industry, and we're likely to see growth there. But the very high volumes, for example, that we would have seen at Pershing, the transaction volumes are going to fall back to what we think more normalized levels, which they've begun -- we've begun to do, and we've seen that in the Asset Servicing to a certain extent as well.",neutral,0.2328,0.3116,0.4556

5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,I had a question around the press. Now that the rules are set in April 1 is the kickoff date for the new rules. Could you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that capital stack? And what you would do with the press here?,neutral,0.035,0.0243,0.9406
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Mike, I'll turn that one over to you.",neutral,0.0384,0.0222,0.9394
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Look, obviously, Betsy, as you know, we're in the middle of CCAR. So we're not going to talk much about sort of what our capital plan looks like at this point. But as you sort of think about where -- given the increase in the balance sheet, where we're most constrained right now is Tier 1 leverage. And I think as you sort of think about, perhaps, that could be a good -- depending on how long we sort of remain constrained there, that could be a good way to continue to fund that. I think we're going to continue to look at opportunities to either refi, perhaps if that comes back in the market and pricing comes back to where it was just 4, 5, 6 weeks ago. So we're continuing to look at the capital stack, and we'll give you more once CCAR is done.",neutral,0.1583,0.0138,0.8279
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"And then when I'm thinking about the funding mix, there's room for your funding cost to come down, obviously, with not only deposits, but in looking at the long-term debt, is there some opportunity there as well in this environment to reduce the funding costs?",neutral,0.3259,0.0837,0.5904
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,Mike?,neutral,0.0442,0.1011,0.8547

5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Yes. Yes, well, just looking at the yield on the long-term debt, is there room there to bring that down in addition to the deposit cost of funds here over the long term?",neutral,0.0696,0.2989,0.6316
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"I think lower rates are going to impact our funding costs overall, right? And I think you're going to see that come through in the second quarter. So I think you will see that.",positive,0.539,0.0453,0.4157
0,Operator,,"Next, move to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.",neutral,0.0508,0.0142,0.935
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Mike, can you talk a little bit about -- more about just helping us understand because it's been a while now on the fee waiver side. So the $50 million to $75 million, can you just help us understand what that means when you say net of distribution expense, where it shows up in the income statement? And then would there be logically, just because rates are going down, a bigger potential impact as you move past 2Q, just on the direction of rates?",neutral,0.0591,0.3323,0.6086
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I think I'll try to give you a little bit of the things that we're sort of thinking about related to that. But -- so first and foremost, this is going to have an impact on government funds first, right, as you sort of think about where yields are. And one of the variables that makes it pretty hard to estimate right now is just where T-bill yields are. So a week -- over the last 3 weeks, they've gone from negative to a 20-plus basis points, back down a bit now over the last day or so. And so that's going to be a big driver of the -- when they start -- when fee waivers start to kick in and the depth of them as well. And so you sort of have to keep that in mind. And as you sort of think about the funds in our Asset Management business that may get impacted by it, that may be distributed through other parts of the company. Some of those fee waivers will be offset by lower distribution expenses in those businesses. So you'll see the fee waivers come through the fee line. And then you'll see distribution expenses lower as they start to impact those funds.",neutral,0.0707,0.4151,0.5142
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,Okay. Got it...,neutral,0.1895,0.0163,0.7941
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"And I'll add a little bit. Ken, I'll add a little bit to that. It's important to note the difference between prime and government funds. So the yield in prime funds is, it can certainly support the fees. Initially, there was avoidance of prime funds. So -- and we're starting to see some investors come back to them. So that could have an impact that would neutralize some of it. And Mike's point is there going to be enough yield in assets and government funds to generate the fees. And the huge amount of issuance in T-bills has kind of surprised us a little bit and put a little bit of yield into that. But that can't be certain that could come down again.",neutral,0.2784,0.06,0.6616
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Got it. And just a follow-up on the cost side. Obviously, you're adjusting to try to keep costs flat in this environment. Can you just talk a little bit more about what do you shift? Is it -- do you push out some investment spend? Is it an incentive comp adjustment? What are the ins and outs of your ability to hold the line there that you're attempting to do?",neutral,0.0606,0.0257,0.9137
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Thank you. Mike, do you want to take that?",neutral,0.0475,0.0234,0.9292
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. We haven't seen -- so first, we haven't really seen any impact on our most important investments. And as you sort of look at the investment portfolio, and you get deeper into the list, there's always opportunity to sort of reprioritize the timing of some of those things. And so we're doing that. You're going to see -- I'll state the obvious, but you're going to see lower travel and business development costs that will be part of it. Although Todd said, we're not going to have any restructuring or layoffs through the rest of the year, we're also putting a lot of discipline around new hires that we're bringing in -- during this environment. So I think it's a multitude of factors that you highlighted that help us have the confidence to get there.",neutral,0.1758,0.1831,0.6411
0,Operator,,We'll next move to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0416,0.0139,0.9445
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"And also, congrats, Todd. It's good to see that you get the frontline role. Let me just start with maybe, Todd -- thanks, Mike, for giving us a pretty good outlook for the activity levels coming into the second quarter. But Todd, maybe you can give us some perspective on what you kind of see for the rest of the year. Obviously, extremely difficult to predict. But with the government intervention and the uncertainty about the path to recovery, how are you seeing that potentially impact some of the key business lines in activity? And also including comments on the backstop on the Fed on prime money funds, to the extent, do you get much more confidence in people investing in prime funds versus government.",neutral,0.1339,0.0219,0.8442
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Well, first of all, as I had mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of that. So we are seeing a little bit of positive flows into the prime funds. But if you look at activity levels, we would expect them to, obviously, come down from the surge that we saw toward the end of March, but probably be elevated. And again, anything we say, there's just so much uncertainty to the environment and the situation that we face. And it's really hard for us to look out long-term until we get on the other side of this -- of the health crisis. But that being said, we wouldn't expect to stay at the extraordinarily high levels that we saw in March, with the exception perhaps of our clearing and collateral management business just because there is going to be so much debt issuance. But in the rest of our businesses, the transaction volumes component of Pershing business, the same thing in Asset Servicing, we would expect that to moderate just about under any circumstances, unless we just saw another couple of blips and more of, what I call, a seesaw activity that could take place over the remainder of the year.",neutral,0.2144,0.2513,0.5343
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"And then the organic growth efforts that you're doing as well, like in deposit gathering and then collateral management, is that on track? Or is that sort of a bit suspended in its environment?",neutral,0.0401,0.0933,0.8667
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I would say if you look at the organic growth, especially around the deposits, I mean we had -- we have seen some positives there. Obviously, there were surge deposits that are just going to be associated with this interest rate environment in this financial environment. But when we look out at our other businesses, we have room to gain some market share. I think we've done that in our payments business. We had some good wins in the first quarter in our Asset Servicing business. I would expect under this environment, people are probably going to slow down, making a whole lot of transitions. We've got a healthy pipeline, both in our asset servicing and Pershing business. I'm not sure a lot of people are going to make a whole lot of change. We are seeing some new fund complexes come on, but we're also seeing some being deferred.",neutral,0.3145,0.3413,0.3442
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Great. That's helpful. And then Mike, just real quick on NII outlook in the second quarter. Does that exclude FX hedging activity?",neutral,0.0748,0.022,0.9032
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I mean, FX -- not FX hedge, but the hedging activity is hard to predict because it's at a point in time at the end of the quarter. So we're not making an assumption either way on that at this point.",neutral,0.0473,0.0793,0.8734

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Congrats, Todd. Quick question on Pershing and kind of what you've been seeing with all the changes going on in the industry and kind of what that means for the pipeline in that business. Has it helped? Or is it too early to say at this point in time?",neutral,0.0728,0.021,0.9061
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and Mike can add some color. First of all, I think it's a little early to say. Pershing has a different model. And I think clients are quite interested in seeing a more open architected approach to what some of their competitors are doing. So I think the conversations are quite healthy there. I think the pipeline continues to be strong. They've come out with a very competitive subscription priced alternative to meet whatever the demand of that client base is. We're continuing to invest in our advisory services business. So I don't think it's -- I don't think there's any significant impact that we're seeing from some of the consolidation elsewhere in the business, other than it's making us a little bit more of a differentiated alternative. And I'd also -- I mentioned that Pershing did quite well through the crisis. So it was able to keep its technology up and running and accommodate the surge in the growth, which, in some instances, as we point out, it was 3 to 4x. I don't know, Mike, do you have anything to add to that?",positive,0.5408,0.0117,0.4475
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. And I would just say, probably more broadly outside of just Pershing, I think we're seeing the benefits of a lot of the investments we've been making over the last couple of years. And I think clients are seeing that as well. I know anecdotally, we heard from a client that just we brought on to our middle office service late last year, saying, ""I'm not sure how I could have done this without you and couldn't have dealt with all of the increase in the volatility on my own."" And so I think we're seeing that sentiment really across -- more broadly across the client base.",positive,0.7461,0.0217,0.2322
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Okay. And then just separate question. On those deposits that you saw come in, in surge in March, they're rolling off the balance sheet now. Are those now just going more so into your own liquidity products and that's been factored into the few waivers that you gave in the second quarter? Are they just rolling off completely?",neutral,0.0377,0.2496,0.7128
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Well, why don't I take that one, and then Mike, you can jump in. If you think about what happened in the ecosystem, so when there was a lot of draws, for example, under these commitments around the country, a lot of that cash had to go somewhere. Some of it was deposited back in banks, and a lot of it went into government funds. Initially, government funds had nowhere to invest. So a lot of that ended up in the money market funds where we were the custodian. So we saw that big spike. That's now -- a lot of that spike has normalized itself out as there are other alternative investments for those government funds. Some of those were our own money market funds and some of them were competitor money market funds. I think that's the biggest, the biggest most volatile component of the cash that we saw move.",neutral,0.0509,0.0686,0.8805

17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,Mike?,neutral,0.0442,0.1011,0.8547
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Mike, as I said earlier, we're -- we use a multiple -- many scenarios that sort of go into sort of thinking about what the ultimate reserving looks like. But it's a scenario where you don't see a meaningful sort of uplift or doesn't fully recover until you're into the middle of next year. So you start a recovery in the latter part of the year, and you -- it doesn't fully recover until later in 2021. As I said earlier as well, only a small portion of the reserve is related to either actual borrower downgrades or the increase in the loan portfolio. The remainder of it is related to the changing economic environment and the way that flows through the new accounting standard.",neutral,0.0433,0.1024,0.8542
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"I guess so what I'm getting to is, it's not just unique to you, it's the industry. So it seems like you're planning for kind of a ""U"" recovery. But you have an infrastructure for a ""V"" recovery, like you're retaining your employees, your expenses should be kind of flat this year. I'm going to guess you're not changing tech spending, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Yes. Well, why don't I start? So we did give a guidance or Mike gave guidance that we do expect expenses, Mike, to be lower than they otherwise would have been. We think that having the human resources here is the right thing to do, not only for them, but also to position ourselves well to service our clients through this kind of an environment and trying to make any significant changes just wouldn't be particularly prudent on our part. That being said, we are controlling other components of our cost. We want to continue to make the investments in technology that we can. I'm sure some of that will be delayed and could be somewhat different prioritization. But we're going to keep a very close eye on our expenses. We think we can do a little bit better than the guidance that we had previously given for a number of reasons.

4,Alexander Blostein,,"To echo everybody's comments, congratulations to Todd. Question for you guys with respect to just broader liquidity in the system. Clearly, there's been a tremendous amount of cash flows coming to the sidelines, and that's both the Fed action as well as the general risk of backdrop. How should we think about BK's ability to sort of absorb these deposits? So changes to spot SLR definitely helped, but there's lots of other considerations. So kind of help us think through the ramifications of this a little bit longer term and how the balance sheet could ultimately be in terms of size beyond the first quarter?",neutral,0.1168,0.0168,0.8664
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Mike, do you want to take that?",neutral,0.0446,0.0228,0.9327
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, I think the SLR change is sort of helpful that's out there. But I think as you sort of look at our constraints on the balance sheet, it's been Tier 1 leverage based on the overall size of the balance sheet. And I think we have been able to sort of work through that with our clients pretty effectively so far. And as Todd said, as the environment normalizes a bit for the money funds and the rate environment sort of settles down, we've seen those real surge balances come off. And so our expectation as things normalize more is that the balance sheet will either sort of hold steady or sort of come down from where we are right now. And so we feel like we can sort of work through that pretty effectively at -- with the current capital that we've got.",neutral,0.3679,0.1561,0.476
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. And then just a couple of cleanups around NIR. Can you help quantify the hedging benefits in the quarter? I know it hits NIR and shows up in FX. So just to, to clean that up. And also any sense of new money yield on the fixed portion of the securities portfolio as that matures and gets reinvested? Just trying to get a sense of the headwind to NIR beyond the second quarter on that fixed scale of the portfolio.",neutral,0.1013,0.0476,0.8511
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Sure. So I'll take the first piece on the hedging benefit. So this is kind of really sort of simple. We have interest rate swaps in the portfolio. And the way they're valued every day sort of creates some basis risk between OIS and LIBOR. And really, all we're doing is sort of hedging that basis risk that's created from interest rate swaps. And that impact for the quarter is based on where it all ends up on the day -- at the end of -- 1 day at the end of the quarter. So there's really nothing else sort of happening there. And you can kind of see the relative impact on the slide in the presentation. And so that's a hard thing to sort of predict in terms of where it's going to end up at the end of the quarter. As you sort of think about the securities portfolio, I mean, you can kind of see where rates are right now as you sort of think about both the fixed rate and the floating rate piece of the portfolio. And I think as we sort of look at our investment strategy going forward, we're doing whatever we can to try to get some yield out of it. And I think the reinvestment rates are down from what you saw, obviously, in the second quarter. But just a reminder, the overall duration of the portfolio is just a couple of years, right? So we're not buying a lot of 30-year treasuries as we sort of think about this portfolio.
