0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brennan Hawken from UBS.,neutral,0.0463,0.0188,0.9349
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Emily, there was a lot of walk-through there on the revenue guide, so I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly and understand where I should index. And you guys provide a lot of disclosure in -- on Slide 22. 
Is the right starting point that we use the fee revenue ex fee waivers and notable items for 2020, which is the 13.1% and then we layer in the different various impacts that you laid out and then take the new run rate for fee waivers expected in 1Q and then kind of annualize that? Is that the right way to think about it? And how does the strengthening of the dollar play into that? Sorry.",neutral,0.0552,0.0261,0.9187
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So just to -- I guess just to -- I will break down each and every piece. But ultimately, if you'd look at our full year 2020, if you actually -- and you'll -- if actually take into account, we try to spell out as best as possible, the impact of waivers. Likewise, we are expecting an increase in market appreciation as well as we're going to have some favorability in terms of the weakening dollar. If you put all of that together, year-on-year revenues will be essentially flat and up 3% ex fee waivers.",positive,0.9346,0.0348,0.0306
6,Brennan Hawken,,Got it.,neutral,0.0781,0.028,0.8939
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Fee revenue. That's fee revenue, Brennan.",neutral,0.0579,0.0253,0.9167
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"That's fee -- yes. Sorry. That's fee revenue, yes.",neutral,0.0547,0.0322,0.9132
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"And that is assuming -- and who knows where the dollar is going to be, but we just used the spot dollar at year-end.",neutral,0.0559,0.0332,0.9109
6,Brennan Hawken,,Fair enough. So the 12.77% is the number we should focus on to be flat basically ex all those puts and takes?,neutral,0.0615,0.0971,0.8414
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,Yes.,neutral,0.1082,0.0226,0.8692
19,Emily Hope Portney,,Correct.,neutral,0.0354,0.0602,0.9043
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Great. Excellent. And then expenses flat, which is in line with what you gave in December on a constant currency, but we've seen the weakening dollar. And so when we think about the expense line, if the dollar remains unchanged from where we are now, and of course, we can calibrate that through the year, depending on the different factors, we'll see a roughly 1.5% uplift on the operating expense line from the 2020 level. Is that fair?",positive,0.8388,0.0691,0.0921
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Correct, correct.",neutral,0.0799,0.0383,0.8818
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay, okay, okay. Excellent. I just wanted to try to clarify some of that. And when we think about the deposits dropping from the 4Q average level, are we -- is it fair to assume that we'll probably shake out at a level that's above the third quarter? Or are you guys thinking that we might actually even revert to down to that level or below? Is there any help you can provide in trying to think about how to gauge the magnitude of that normalization in the deposit side?",neutral,0.079,0.4481,0.4729
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So ultimately, we're projecting deposits to be relatively flat from here or potentially to decline a bit. Now in fairness, we could see excess liquidity in the system. But of course, we are monitoring our capital ratios, and we have to optimize returns to shareholders. So we will be actively, very proactively, managing the size of the balance sheet. So that's what we've -- that's ultimately roughly flat from here or slightly lower.",negative,0.1294,0.669,0.2016
0,Operator,,And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.,neutral,0.0476,0.0237,0.9286
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Emily, just to follow up on the -- your organic growth outlook. I'm just wondering if you could help us put in context like just what that measures, right? It's not necessarily a stock measure of just revenue growth. 
So like is it taking the core building blocks of the segments and just kind of like measuring the unit growth? And how do you put that 1.5% into context with the overall fee guide, right? Can -- do we -- I don't know if you can maybe just walk us through that.",neutral,0.0685,0.0153,0.9162
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So when we think about organic growth, we define it as pretty much growth excluding market appreciation or depreciation, excluding currency impact and excluding waivers. So I mean, that's generally how we think about it. I think Todd had mentioned that we -- and over the course of 2020, it was around between 1% and 2%. We're expecting it to remain pretty much stable at that -- at those levels, and that's embedded into the fee forecast that I've just given.",neutral,0.1028,0.0201,0.8771
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a specific question on asset servicing fees that -- on the income statement side, seeing that there was a little bit of a -- there was an increase in fee waivers in that 11.38% number, but even if you exclude that, Asset Servicing was down. The press release mentioned something about some repricing. I'm just wondering if you can walk through just what happened, the pushes and pulls there of why the core was down sequentially, whether it being organic growth repricing activity, et cetera?",negative,0.0675,0.6882,0.2443
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So we had -- in Asset Servicing in the fourth quarter, we had higher -- we were helped by higher market levels, higher FX and other trading and higher liquidity balances, but that was offset by waivers, sec lending was down a bit. And yes, you are correct. There was a bit of some lumpy repricing in the quarter, not -- ultimately, we don't control actually the timing, obviously, of repricing we happen to have had 2 or 3 large relationships reprice on the back of renewal. So we ultimately retained the business, but that was a modest headwind as well.",negative,0.2789,0.625,0.096
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. And then I guess just sort of a quick follow-up to that, is that -- have we rebased? Does it kind of build off of here? Or how do you think about those repricing versus renewals as you think forward?",neutral,0.053,0.0244,0.9226
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure, sure. So as you all know, repricing is very lumpy. You will see the full impact of those repricing throughout the year, but it's not like we've seen anything structural or underlying -- an underlying change in the trend of repricing. It's always been a modest headwind that we've offset with greater efficiency and net new business.",positive,0.4572,0.1364,0.4064

19,Emily Hope Portney,,Yes.,neutral,0.1082,0.0226,0.8692
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. So first question just on, I think the deposit commentary. I wanted to get a better understanding as to why you think deposits aren't going to be continuing to increase as much as they have been. I mean I think the Fed is still increasing the size of the balance sheet. I expect that you would get some benefit from that.",positive,0.6684,0.0225,0.309
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I think I'll start, and then I'm sure Emily will join in on this. I would expect that the Fed is going to continue to buy securities, which kind of adds to the deposit base. And there's still some question exactly how the very large balances that sit at the U.S. Treasury at the Fed, whether they're going to wind those down. So the 2 of them could increase the overall reserves and deposits in the system. 
That being said, we can manage some of that. And now that we're back in -- and we did that a number of years ago. So we targeted some of the less valuable balances. And once we're able to use our capital, that's not how we're going to use it. It's not -- it won't be particularly efficient. So we've demonstrated that we can do that. And of course, any valuable deposits we'll take on, but if they're just short term with very little benefit to them, we'll discourage that.",neutral,0.2105,0.0322,0.7573
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. That's via pricing or what have you. I guess the other question, Todd, is you mentioned kind of one of the strategies here that you're going to be executing on this year is to increase the efficiency and the delivery of the products and services. 
And I wanted to understand how you're thinking about that with regard to some of the OCC rules that have been out there recently regarding stablecoin. I'm just wondering is how much does the blockchain initiatives that you've got underway drive that efficiency improvement? Or is that more of a hobby? And does it matter that the OCC has approved banks for stablecoin? Does that factor into your strategy?",neutral,0.0951,0.0179,0.8869
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I think it clarifies things a bit. And there is a fair amount of activity. And by the way, we have appointed somebody in front of what I'll call the tokenization efforts. They're really across 3 fronts, and we are seeing some acceleration around tokenized assets, tokenized fiat currencies and also cryptocurrency. So we're seeing a lot more interest in cryptocurrency and custodizing and other services associated with it. We've done a little bit there. We have been a custodian for a big futures contract, and it's kind of like getting it started. 
In terms of tokenized currency, we've been a member of utility settlement cloud, which now finality from an investor and a participant in development from the beginning, and we do see that having a meaningful applications. And we're also involved in tokenizing assets, and we're looking at what we might be able to do to tokenize into tri-party repo to make it more -- even more efficient. So I think it's going to be an important element, and we're investing not hugely in it right now. It's not a -- I don't see a lot of imminent revenues, but it's something that we will definitely be on the forefront on.",neutral,0.1829,0.0158,0.8013
0,Operator,,And we'll move to our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0497,0.0208,0.9296
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Emily, just a quick one on the net interest revenue outlook. The -- I think that you were implying it after a 3% drop in 1Q versus 4Q would be the guidance will be stable for 2Q,3Q, 4Q. Just wondering what the headwinds are if we are -- if we do have this steeper yield curve, I guess. Is the forward curve your assumption with that? And then what would be the headwinds that would keep that stable if we were to see a steepening yield curve and lower prepaid fees as we go throughout the year?",neutral,0.1316,0.1954,0.673
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. Brian, our got -- you've got that spot on. Our guidance is take the fourth quarter run rate, discount that, call it, about 3%, and that's a good proxy, not only for the first quarter, but when you think through the average run rate for the rest for the year, at least based on what we know now. We don't try to get cute. We just use the forward curve. And despite a steepening of the curve, we're still very sensitive to short-end rates, which have actually come down. 
Also, when you think about where we play the duration of our investments, that part of the curve is actually not up as much as the longer end. And I guess the last thing I would just point out about prepayment fees, which you've mentioned, is that, despite a steepening of the curve, we really haven't seen mortgage rates increase that much. So we're not expecting those at the moment anyway to really decline much. So that's really -- all of this, of course, is subject to change based on the rate environment, but that's how we're projecting.",neutral,0.132,0.2734,0.5946
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,Okay. That's clear. And then a second question...,neutral,0.0499,0.0441,0.906
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Brian, I'll just add just to make sure it's particularly clear. I mean when you think about the steepness of the yield curve, we've seen that, but we've also seen short-term rates come in a little bit, and that's meaningful. So if we do continue to see it, and we continue to -- and that starts to slow down prepayment speeds or even mortgage spreads were to widen a little bit, that we would expect prepayment speeds to slow down. But all we do is we use the current market's expected future rates, really the forward curve. So that's what's in that estimate.",neutral,0.0643,0.2229,0.7129
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Right. Okay. That really makes sense. And then maybe, Todd, just going back to some of the initiatives you mentioned in the early part of the call and trying to triangulate that with the organic growth rate. So the 1.5% organic growth rate, I think that implies that your number is around $250 million of organic revenue expectations for '21. 
And then you mentioned -- I wrote down 5 different initiatives: The front-to-back mandate, the Data Vault, ESG investment analytics, the collateral management, money market for intraparty repo solution and the commercial payments, real-time payments system as well. Are those more -- just to get a flavor, are those contributing more to, I guess, what -- if we could sort of frame what portion of the organic revenue growth in '21 may be attributable to that. Or is it really more for building that in '22 and continue with potentially the organic growth rate improving in '22 as a result of [indiscernible]?",neutral,0.0706,0.0173,0.9121
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I mean a little bit of both. So part of the -- we had a very strong sales quarter in the fourth quarter. But most of those won't be implemented, Brian, until the end of -- towards the end of the year, so they're going to have de minimis impact on the revenues for this year, but they'll go into next year. 
Some of those are because of the -- of what we've done around data and analytics, the Data Vault. And the ones with Janus Henderson. They're an early adopter. And so that will take some time to implement. And then we think we're gaining some additional traction. When we look at some of the applications, we've had many, many, many demonstrations and many users on a trial basis, for example, on our ESG app. So that's starting to build some momentum. The trial management program that we're investing in, we don't expect -- we expect to start seeing some of the benefits of that toward the end of the year. So there's a little benefit in the organic growth rate this year. And we would expect that to accelerate a bit next year.",positive,0.5573,0.0225,0.4202
0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo.,neutral,0.0387,0.0246,0.9367
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"A follow-up -- a question on one positive trend, one maybe negative trend. But on the negative trend, you said you had elevated transaction volumes encouraging and they should moderate. Have they moderated already? And what kind of see-through do you have to the kind of market situation if those transaction volumes are moderating? 
And on the positive side, you said Asset Servicing, you had the best sales in 10 quarters in the fourth quarter and that should help in about a year. How are you able to close these deals in the pandemic environment? I mean are you closing deals over Zoom? Are these existing relationships? Because I keep hearing like getting new relationships is tough, so just wanted some color behind both of those trends.",neutral,0.2131,0.1503,0.6367
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. No, we -- one of the big transactions that we're closing was entirely virtual. And that was with a very large -- and a lot of these have been entirely virtual. And we've built a very good relationship with that particular organization's large European asset manager. In fact, right before the pandemic or right at the time, I was going to travel to see them. And unfortunately, I was unable to do it. 
So there have been, from soup to nuts, things slowed down for a while. But it's getting a little more normalized on the institutional front. I'd say on the wealth front with individuals, that's a little bit more challenging, Mike. But on the institutional front, it's certainly not ideal, but we've had many instances of where we've been able to handle that. 
In terms of your question around Pershing, I mean, we're only a couple of weeks into the new year, and volumes generally have stayed pretty strong relative to the fourth quarter. I just think that's a little bit too early to call. Our estimate is that they would normalize a bit. Maybe they won't. Maybe we'll stay up here. But that's our best guess at this point. 
You had a third question in there, and I don't recall what it was, Mike, but I'll try to take it.",neutral,0.1474,0.255,0.5976

4,Alexander Blostein,,"Great. Just a follow-up around the organic growth target that you guys put out there at 1.5%. Can you talk a little bit about what you're assuming for pricing dynamics within that across sort of your various businesses? 
Obviously, it sounds like Q4 maybe was a little bit of an anomaly of several large accounts just kind of happened to reprice at the same time. But maybe give us a sense kind of what like that unit repricing looks like? Is it 1%, 2%, kind of what that is? And how do you incorporate that into your guidance?",neutral,0.0428,0.0301,0.9271
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Emily, why don't you take that? You want to take it?",neutral,0.0401,0.0489,0.911
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. I'll start and please add. So I mean, repricing pressure is just the norm in our businesses. So it's always a headwind, but a very modest headwind. And we are -- we routinely and always actually offset that -- more than offset that with greater efficiency and net new business. So we don't -- look, there has been some lumpy repricing, but we don't see any underlying structural change or trend. So from that perspective, it's not hugely material.",neutral,0.1534,0.0863,0.7603
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"And part of our pricing schedules, too, are graduated. So as the value of the assets increase, the pricing does reflect that volume. So -- but this is specific to repricing existing clients as they benefit from some of the operating efficiencies and the growth in their own business. And typically, it's fairly -- it's been fairly stable for a number of years, the downdraft on that. It was just a little lumpy this year. We don't -- we see it going back to normal, but that lumpiness will have a little bit of an impact on 2021.",neutral,0.1898,0.1758,0.6343
4,Alexander Blostein,,Got it. Understood. And then just a clarification around NIR. It sounds like you guys are assuming MBS prepayments will remain at current levels for '21.

And so we are growing faster in the registered advisory firms and -- than the broker-dealer side of the business, but the broker-dealer side of the business is still meaningful, and it's a large component of it. And so as we look into next year, some of the consolidations or the [ self-tuning ] decisions have offset the very strong growth that we've seen so that's going to be a little bit of a drag for Pershing for this year.

7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Great. Just Todd, I just wanted to circle back on the front-to-back mandate that you won. It sounds like the largest of the ones that you been servicing. But just wanted to get a flavor of how many others that you're doing, given that you are integrated with virtually all of the OMS providers. Or is that a sizeable type of mandate for you if we consider other contract wins? And maybe [indiscernible] with them, too. Yes.",neutral,0.123,0.0142,0.8627
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes, I -- okay. Sure. So I mean, they -- we've integrated now with 6 OMS platforms, partnerships with Bloomberg, Aladdin and so forth. And through that, we're offering custody insights, information around liquidity, and it's kind of unique capability that we're able to do transactions, holdings and so forth. And I think what it does is it very much enriches the experience of the doing business with us, so I think it's helped us to retain relationships. I think it's helped us to grow a couple of relationships that I've just indicated. So we are starting to get some traction with it. 
Moving on to the data business, which we've been in for some time, but now we've cloud-enabled it and made a much richer capability. We've had a number of large beta clients that have been operating it, and we're now starting to convert some of them. So I think, like, it's not just what they can do with us, but for the first time now, we're starting to see some meaningful wins that I would attribute, maybe not entirely to it, but certainly, that was a helpful driver.",positive,0.641,0.0116,0.3474

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Great. I was wondering if you could just kind of walk through again the tier 1 leverage comments that you made. You had said that this quarter where it was at 6.3%. I think you gave that your target was at 5.5% to 6%, but then you said you thought you were well above where you needed to be. It seems like you're just above kind of what your targets are. So how does that impact your aspirations for capital return?",neutral,0.1036,0.05,0.8465
19,Emily Hope Portney,,Sure. So Tier 1 leverage is 6.3%. I think we've been pretty clear that we're comfortable running more at a rate between 5.5% to 6%. So that does imply that we have significant excess capital. And you can assume that we're going to look to return that to shareholders over the course of the year if we're permitted to do so.,positive,0.4919,0.03,0.4782
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Brian, the other I would add to that, Brian, is that we have excess deposits right now. And so since we're not able to do anything with our capital, we did -- we're not really pushing them away or managing them as carefully as we could. Once we get back into a normal capital management cycle, deposits that aren't worth anything, we're not going to keep them here.",neutral,0.0492,0.2419,0.709
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"And so then when you talk about the deposits, how does that play into the money market fee waivers? Are you anticipating pushing those off into the money market funds, which has been the driver of the fees? Or if that were to happen, that could be an incremental negative to the fee waiver guidance?",negative,0.0279,0.5597,0.4124
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. I can take that. So I mean the fee waiver guidance and the increase in that is really tied to what we're seeing in the short end and T-bill rates and repo rates have actually come down since we originally projected. And that's really what the $175 million now that I mentioned. You are correct, with a lot of excess reserves that, if that all ends up in money markets, that could ultimately put more pressure. So that is a potential risk. 
The one thing also, just while we're on waivers, that I just would highlight is that Pershing did hit its full run rate in terms of waivers in the fourth quarter. So you will start to see those waivers increase in other lines of business. So Asset Servicing, Issuer Services, IM, Treasury Services, for example.",negative,0.1451,0.5084,0.3465
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"So Brian, if money market mutual funds increased as the balance has increased, we would certainly waive more fees. But net-net, we'd have more fees. And so it's just that we would -- it's 100% of the component that we get. So they've basically been relatively stable. So when we do these comparisons, the volumes have been relatively flat. So that hasn't created any noise. So if money has moved into money market funds, there probably will be much less fees than they typically would have been, but there will probably still be some fees.",neutral,0.2027,0.0818,0.7155
