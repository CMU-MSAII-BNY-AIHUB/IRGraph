0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.,neutral,0.0384,0.0281,0.9335
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"I know it's a different client base, but I'm curious if you think the pricing reductions on the e-broker side and the retail side of the broker land can have an impact onto your Pershing RIA clearing business? Just could you help us think through that?",neutral,0.174,0.0422,0.7838
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Sure. Glenn, it's Todd. Our business model is quite a bit different than the e-traders. As you know, we're a B2B, we're not a B2C business, so we don't actually charge commissions. We get paid on a number of different revenue streams, like assets as well as declaring and settlement. So we don't foresee this as having any material impact at this time.",neutral,0.0392,0.0377,0.9231
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Okay. And maybe just a quickie follow-up on the NII. Because I appreciate -- I actually just want to make sure I wrote it down. The NIR, down 4% to 6% versus the lease-adjustment number in the third quarter? And could you just repeat that part? I just want to make sure that we get the right jumping-off point for 4Q and rolling into next year.",negative,0.0169,0.9378,0.0453
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Glenn, it's Mike. If you look at Page 6 of the deck, the lease-adjusted number for the third quarter was $800 million, so that's your jumping-off point, and so the 4% to 6% off of that base. And if you -- in my commentary, I also mentioned part of the decline is related to the modest benefit we saw from the repo activity in the third quarter, so that's about 1% of it.",negative,0.0423,0.8779,0.0798
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,And the rest is just the cuts we've seen and the deposit migration?,neutral,0.05,0.1368,0.8132
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Correct, yes. It's net interest-bearing deposits coming down a little bit. It's the yield on the portfolio continuing to grind down a bit. And it's based on where we see deposit balances right now, which are a little bit lower than what we saw in the third quarter. But as you know, it's very early in the quarter to project with a high degree of certainty at this point.",negative,0.023,0.9126,0.0643
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Okay. And I just want to make sure that you saw some extra deposit slide in from the repo mess in the quarter, but unclear if they stick around. I'm putting words in your mouth, but I just want to see what your thoughts are.",neutral,0.0543,0.0516,0.8941
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. No, I think the deposits we saw -- the incremental deposits we saw in the third quarter were not necessarily related to the repo volatility, that was just underlying client behavior. We made some money by deploying some of our excess liquidity into the repo market during those few days. That, coupled with our cleared repo program that we've got for clients is where we made the extra money during those few days of the volatility.",neutral,0.1084,0.1195,0.772
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"That wasn't -- Glenn, that wasn't a huge amount of money. I mean we had -- we have a lot of liquidity. If there's a little bit of a distortion in the market, we'll take advantage of it, and we did. And had a little bit of help, but it didn't impact balances.",neutral,0.3009,0.086,0.6131
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0293,0.0493,0.9213
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Todd, first, just a quick one on that -- at sort of a high level. Just wanted -- interested in your thoughts on level setting and very helpful to hear your comments in the beginning of the call. But clearly, we had a bit of a movement on the top here with BK, with Charlie moving on and you stepping in. And so, clearly, you were part of the management team, you've been at Bank of New York for a very, very long time, developed this -- the plan so that seems straightforward. But can you help us maybe think about tactical time frames? How is the Board thinking about their search at this point? Most investors assume that you're going to be part of the consideration for that search, is that fair? And can you help us think about, just in the near term, how there might be some tactical adjustments in strategy? Or is it going to be very, very similar to how we're -- how we've been going, steady as you go, so to speak?",neutral,0.106,0.0176,0.8764
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay, Brennan, there is a lot there. But let me start that with the change at the top, the Board executed its succession plan and it's going through the due diligence and has initiated a search. And I have indicated my interest to be a part of that. So that's in process. And we don't have any strict time frames on that, that will flow as it flows. 
And in terms of my own priorities and anything tactical that we're seeing, frankly, I've been in the middle of driving the change agenda that's been going on that Charlie had led over the past couple of years, and I really felt like I'm an integral part of it. Actually, I've enjoyed it. So what I'm not going to do is revert back to some of the ways that things were. So we're going to continue to drive a very strong performance culture. I see us holding ourselves more accountable. We're expecting -- we really expect and demand excellence from each other. And I'm not going to let that change, so that's at the high level. 
The investments that we're making in technology are going to continue. They're going to be focused on a number of things, not only that we make our services more resilient, that we improve the client experience. And where we're having some real success is around improving operational efficiency, so that continues to be high on my list. And I think there's a lot more, and I would follow my next point here, is that we'll automate and continue to improve operations. I think we've got a lot of tractions there. We can point to a lot of successes and opportunity to do more. 
I got to stay focused on regulatory relations, given who we are and what we're doing, and so that will be a high priority. And finally, Mike and I are now poring through the planning process and we've got to make good decisions around our investment opportunities. We have quite a number of them, and actually that will be fun. So I think it's been a very smooth transition at this point. I don't think anything has changed, people -- and I really am quite pleased with the leadership team, how smoothly they've moved on.",neutral,0.2809,0.0176,0.7015
6,Brennan Hawken,,"That's great color. One question here for Mike. Previously, you guys had guided to the back half of 2019 being flat for operating expenses versus the back half of 2018. I believe that the core expenses in the back half of 2018 were $5.4 billion. Looks like core expenses this quarter was $2.7 billion. Does that mean that we should be looking at core expenses for the fourth quarter to be roughly flat with core to this quarter? Is that fair?",neutral,0.0847,0.3345,0.5808
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I mean I think give and take a little bit, Brennan, so -- but, yes, I mean I think the guidance we gave in terms of sort of being flat year-on-year still, give or take a little bit, still holds.",neutral,0.2412,0.0331,0.7257
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. You mean you obviously laid out the charges, but that would not be core, right?",neutral,0.0487,0.0583,0.893
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,Correct. You have to look through that.,neutral,0.0962,0.0281,0.8757
0,Operator,,"All right, your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.",neutral,0.034,0.0351,0.9309
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"Following up on your comments about the repo disruption and how you had a small benefit, and I know you don't expect it going forward, can you guys give us any color? Is there any benefit on the treasury now or the Fed, I should say, coming back in? They're not calling it a quantitative easing, but we know they're going to come in and start buying securities. Do you guys see any benefit of -- for your business from their activities?",neutral,0.1346,0.0204,0.845
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Well, yes, the Fed conducts its open market transactions through repo and they do use our repo platform, our tri-party platform, for some of those transactions. It will be very, very modest, if any, impact to our revenue. So it will obviously impact the rate at which repo trades, but it's a de minimis impact. 
The good news about the business and the tri-party business and the collateral management business is it continues to grow. So we've seen -- we saw significant growth in the past quarter. Some of that less than or about 1/3 or so of that, was from the conversions that we had from last year. But the rest of it is either new clients or additional growth with the existing clients. Collateral management and repo is -- it is growing as the uncleared margin rules grow and the demand for secured credit grows. So we like our position there and I can go on more about this because we're -- one of our biggest investments is in what we call the future of collateral management and making our systems interoperable in a way that just makes it seamless for our clients to move collateral. That will have a huge benefit to them. So a key focus for us, but the disruption in the repo market had little, if any, impact.",positive,0.6322,0.02,0.3478
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"Very good, Todd. And then just as a follow-up, you gave us good color on the sequential look into net interest revenue and what the forward curve is saying about future Fed fund rate cuts. If you guys could paint us a picture for 2020, what would be an ideal interest rate environment for you to benefit from a net interest revenue standpoint? Again, I know -- I don't want to hold you to it, but just curious what would be that ideal environment.",neutral,0.1839,0.0132,0.8028
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"I'll take it. I'm looking at Mike here. A steeper yield curve and fewer leases, it really isn't a lot more complex than that.",neutral,0.0967,0.0314,0.8719
0,Operator,,"All right, your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Usdin with Jefferies.",neutral,0.0347,0.0375,0.9278
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Just a couple of follow-ups on the NII front. All right, Mike, so can you talk a little bit about, it seems like if your -- the balance sheet were to be flattish from here even that the NIM is obviously still grinding down, can you talk us through you mentioned the little less competitiveness on the deposit side. But the dynamics of the asset portfolio repricing, that whole -- the 3 quarters aspect versus what you're seeing on the deposit betas. Can you give us some color on both sides of what you're seeing?",neutral,0.1633,0.1195,0.7172
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, and I'll start with the portfolio, Ken. And obviously, what you're seeing in the portfolio is yields continue to grind down as sort of rates have come down. It's really no more complicated, I think, than that. And about 1/3 of our portfolio reprices every quarter, either through securities maturing and getting reinvested or through the floating rates component of it. And in most cases, the rates in the portfolio are moving ahead of when the Fed moves. And so you're going to see a decline in the asset yields, first. And then when the Fed moves, you're able to move deposit pricing down, and so you're going to have that lag. And so as rates are declining, it's negative -- it has a negative impact during that period. 
I think on the pricing side, what I said was pricing remains competitive, although it stabilized over the last 90 days, 120 days or so. And so we're seeing pretty consistent competition across a whole series of our competitors, but we're not seeing anything that's irrational across that set right now.",negative,0.0305,0.8603,0.1092
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. And I guess as a follow-up then, so if we just play it forward and you look at your forward curve and you mentioned the October and potentially early '20, at what point do you see the yields on the asset side starting to level out because of that 3 quarter roll through? Like do we get to a point in early next year where you just kind of have flushed everything down? How do we start to assess like when that bottoming point might happen?",neutral,0.0555,0.1864,0.7581
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, I mean, look, I think that's the question I think most people are thinking about. And I think, as you look at -- as you look at it, it's really -- it starts to stabilize when forwards start to stabilize, right? And I think when you look at forwards right now, it's still declining as you look out. And so I think when forwards start to stabilize, you'll start to see the portfolio yields stabilize as well.",negative,0.0786,0.6044,0.317
0,Operator,,"All right, your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.",neutral,0.0353,0.0375,0.9272
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Great. Yes, just 2 quick questions. One, you did mention that the promontory sale is going to close this quarter. Does that mean that gain can be used for additional share repurchases, have you decided to do that? Or is that already included in the CCAR plan?",neutral,0.049,0.0203,0.9306
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,It's something we'll consider as we look forward for our capital plan next year.,neutral,0.1854,0.0098,0.8048
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"So, no, it was not included in our CCAR plan for this year. So we couldn't take that because it hasn't taken place.",neutral,0.0407,0.1491,0.8102
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Okay, but you're not going to do additional share repurchase this year, though?",neutral,0.0542,0.0165,0.9293
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,We'll consider that as part of the plan next year.,neutral,0.1174,0.0098,0.8728
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"And then just focusing on the Investment Management business, I mean you have negative operating leverage in there year-on-year. I mean what does it take to kind of generate positive operating leverage in that segment again?",negative,0.0369,0.7618,0.2013
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"So if you look in our Investment Management business, a number of the businesses are doing pretty well. Our LDI business continues to grow. Our -- credit business in Alcentra is doing pretty well. And in fact, our managers in the U.K. are growing reasonably well. Where we are challenged is in our business in the states, and we've taken some steps to combine those businesses into what we now call Mellon. But until we see that stabilize, it's going to be -- that's where the challenge really resides. So we need to see some improvement in the performance. We think we -- by combining, there are things that we can do operationally to continue to manage the cost, but that's our focus point.",positive,0.8161,0.0123,0.1716
0,Operator,,"And next, we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.",neutral,0.0355,0.0203,0.9441
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Question around deposit growth this quarter. Obviously, pretty nice trends sequentially. I know there's been a strategic focus for you guys to get a larger share of kind of customers' wallets over time. So maybe talk a little bit about the sources of growth this quarter and sort of the traction you're getting in terms of that wallet share gain?",neutral,0.1988,0.0179,0.7833
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Alex, it's Mike. As you highlighted, we've been focused for the better part of a year or a little over that sort of really driving more share of client deposits through a whole series of initiatives. And I think I mentioned in my commentary around Treasury Services, which is a good example where deposits are up around 20%, and I think that's a great example where it's not only about getting deposits, it also brings with it other activity and fees with it as we sort of go after that -- those relationships. And I think that effort that we've got is really across every single one of our businesses with the Asset Servicing, Corporate Trust, Treasury Services, Wealth Management and I think to varying degrees we've had success in growing our share of operating deposits across the different client segments.",neutral,0.4321,0.0122,0.5558
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes, I would add to that, Alex. This was not a focus of ours in years going past, especially in a 0-rate environment and with leverage ratios and so forth. But today, we've established a couple of these campaigns and we've been pretty successful. And we're a very attractive client -- or counterparty, for depositors. And when we can connect it to the businesses, it makes a lot of sense. So the more we can get to payments business, the more opportunity we've got to grow our deposit base. So it's largely just increased focus and targeted campaigns.",neutral,0.4576,0.0127,0.5298
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. And then a more tactical question, I guess. With the Fed being back in the market buying T-bills, historically, we've kind of viewed the depository base of the trust banks as somewhat correlated with the level of excess reserves in the banking system. Would this create a similar dynamics? In other words, if the Fed becomes again more aggressive in buying back treasuries and T-bills, would that be an overall helper to the size of the balance sheet as we go forward?",neutral,0.1583,0.0381,0.8036
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"I think I mean deposits have been correlated in the past to excess reserves, but you sort of -- you really need to look at it over a period of time. In any given quarter, that may or may not be the case, and we'll see how the most recent announcement and activity levels are to play out. And the Fed is just getting into the market now with this week. I think some of those trades settle later in the week for the first time. And so I think it's too early to know exactly what impact it's going to have. And I think you really need to think about it over some period of time, and quarter-to-quarter, it may not play out exactly as the historical trend might indicate.",neutral,0.0552,0.1012,0.8436
0,Operator,,Next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0275,0.0476,0.9248
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"A question for both Todd and Mike on the expenses. I think, Mike, you mentioned, if I understand correctly, it's an estimate of $100 million to $200 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. If you can talk about the underlying expense that, that is projected to reduce, I guess, going into next year. Cognizant that you probably don't want to give guidance for next year yet, but just to get a sense of that. 
And then, I guess, bigger picture, Todd. You talked a long time -- for a long time about investing in technology to increasingly automate the business and reduce that operational cost. And you've done a lot over the last several years making progress on that. So just trying to get a sense of as we move forward over the next, say, 1 to 2 years, is this -- do we have a lot more runway in those initiatives to the extent that we can keep the expenses at least flat for the organization or even down?",neutral,0.1157,0.0468,0.8376
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Brian, why don't I take the latter part of that and I'll hand it over to Mike for the earlier part of the question. We've got nearly 100 programs in place, so we do continue to see significant opportunity to automate a lot more, things like reconciliations. When you look at the accounting platforms and the NAV calculations, there are still many manual processes in there that we are targeting. So I kind of look at -- and there are still locations that we can -- that we need to manage where there's opportunity. 
And as we look out to 2020 and some of the things that we can accelerate, I'll call out a couple of items. Number one, I think, around reconciliations, we can increase the scalability of the land. We've actually been applying machine learning and creating much, much more automated reconciliation process. Doesn't seem like a lot, but if you think about what we do as a company, it is a massive undertaking with a huge amount of headcount dedicated to it. 
We're also investing in a client inquiry system where we'll digitize all of the clients' inquiries into us. That doesn't sound like a lot either, but if you can imagine the millions of transactions that we process, if we can automate how we capture the queries around it. 
We're also automating our instruction capture. And as I mentioned earlier, there's opportunity for us to do more around the accounting services and striking net asset values. 
So the -- so as I look out over the next 2 or 3 years, this is not a -- we're not stopping. There's a lot more that I think we can do here.",neutral,0.0963,0.0163,0.8874
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. And I think as you think about the charges and investments we're making, we've got a very disciplined process to look at the ROIs and the payback periods for each of the investments and we do that for all of them. So just assume that we're doing that as we look at the investments we're making.",neutral,0.0677,0.0284,0.9039
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Okay, that's all great color. And then just a follow up on the Asset Servicing. I think, Todd, you talked about increasing some of the servicing capabilities for alternatives. Do you feel that your -- the platform that you have for that right now is adequate to do that? Or are there potential significant enhancements to come either organically or through acquisition? And I guess could you leverage BlackRock's eFront -- recently acquired eFront platform? I know you've got the relationship with Aladdin.",positive,0.7379,0.0083,0.2538
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I mean let me go to the beginning of that. When we look at the real estate servicing business, we're growing that quite rapidly from investments that we've made previously, and that's just continuing to capture the market. So we see opportunities there without a whole lot of more investments. We'll have to obviously keep the platform current. Where we are making some investments is more around private equity and credit platforms. And we've got a potential -- a couple of potential wins there. And we are not just looking at BlackRock but at others for potential partnerships that we might be able to leverage as well. So, yes, we think in the alt space, without a huge amount of investment, we can continue to capture some growth and some market share.",neutral,0.3365,0.0119,0.6516
0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America.,neutral,0.0274,0.0346,0.938
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Maybe, first, just given some of the traction you're seeing in Pershing and Collateral Management, just where is the firm today in terms of maybe market share? And what strategies you're putting in place to drive additional organic growth and bringing on additional clients?",neutral,0.1944,0.0088,0.7968
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Well, I'll start with Collateral Management first. So if you think about our Collateral Management business, it's primarily around tri-party repo, but there are also uncleared margin rules that are going into effect where the buy side now has to collateralize its derivative transactions. And those are phased in, and so that market is actually growing, so we are benefiting from that. 
Where we're investing is to make it seamless for our clients to move collateral around the world on our platforms, which will make them much more efficient. Effectively, what it does for them, it reduces the amount of liquidity and capital that they have to commit to their own business. So it generates real funding benefits to them, so they're quite excited about it. 
The other thing we're doing is we're investing in the automation of the rule sets. So if you think about a tri-party repo, 2 parties have to have rules and we've automated that rather than making it a manual process, which makes it much, much easier for them to initiate transactions. So that's number one. 
Number two, if you look at the world's repo market, only about 25% of that uses tri-party today. And as we provide this type of services, it will make it much more attractive for people that are doing things, what they call a bilateral repo, which is just doing it directly. So we think we can either use tri-party services or act as the custodian, so we think there is growth potential there. So that's one of the things that we're driving for, and that will be a 2-year process and we're pretty excited about the prospects there. There's a lot going on in the space. 
The other question was around Pershing, same question. Yes, Pershing is a little less impactful on the collateral management space. Pershing is really providing clearance and custody for broker-dealers, investment advisers and, to some extent, there's some prime business there with hedge funds as well. And the beauty there is that market is growing, the advisory business is growing quite rapidly. We're on the corporate side of that, so there was some lost business due to consolidations. We've now implemented enough new business to start to offset that. I think Mike have made that very clear on previous earnings calls and so we see ourselves and the potential to start showing some growth there.",neutral,0.1893,0.0142,0.7966
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Right. That's helpful. And then just a quick cleanup, Mike. Just on the reserve release, did you fully exit the exposure on the utility? And then same thing on the tax rate, just on the low end, any update in terms of the guidance or the outlook?",neutral,0.0382,0.0288,0.933
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"We did fully dispose of the exposure for the utilities, so there is no more left. And on the tax rate, it's a little noisy just given the ins and outs this year, but we haven't given a full year guidance. But what we said in the past is sort of 21%, plus or minus. My guess is we'll be a little bit below that 21%.",neutral,0.0642,0.4345,0.5012

2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"The Asset Servicing business? Sure. I'll take a shot and Todd can add some color in there. I think as we look at the things that we're doing to continue to improve the quality of the service we have, that is directly aimed at continuing to reduce attrition and improve the service levels for our clients. And I think where we put focus on that with our largest clients, we're seeing really good traction and results. 
I think so when you look at the impact that client losses or attrition had in the quarter, it's pretty similar to what you would have seen over the last number of quarters or a couple of years.",positive,0.7903,0.0159,0.1938
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"Okay. And then, Todd, you mentioned decision-making around upcoming investment opportunities. Seems like we've talked about a few of them here, but maybe at a higher level, can you talk about your priorities and any additional color on the opportunities you are most excited about?",neutral,0.0699,0.0151,0.915
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I spelled out the priorities earlier and they really continue to basically be continue with the change agenda that I've been part of over the past couple of years, and I look forward to continuing to drive that. So we're not going to revert to practices that were weaker than where I think we are now. That's for sure. 
In terms of right now, where I think we're seeing opportunities is in the wealth space around Pershing and our own Wealth Management business, in the -- we talked about the CLAR business probably in too much detail, and I gave you a lot of color there. But Asset Servicing still has quite a few opportunities. We talked a little bit about alts. But to Mike's earlier point around attrition, as long as our capabilities are as strong as they are and our services is as good as it is, the attrition rate will go down. And I think that -- I think we'll keep moving the needle on it. 
You're always going to have some clients leave for some reason or other. But we've got to make it more and more difficult for them to leave. That's why we're pretty keen on these partnerships that we've had. The one that we announced with Bloomberg in the quarter is another indication of that, and by being able to make it much more convenient for them to do business with us by a single sign-on through Bloomberg to get all kinds of custody information, makes it more difficult to leave and that's what we want to do.",neutral,0.1163,0.17,0.7137
