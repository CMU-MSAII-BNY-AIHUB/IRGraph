And the first question today comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.",neutral,0.0353,0.028,0.9367
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Jason, I'd like to echo your prior comments for Mark as well. It was great working with you. Good luck in your next role. 
So maybe to start with the NII-related questions, and I'm sure you guys had expected given the theme of the quarter. You've spoken in the past about deposit outflows about a month ago. They seems like they have continued a little bit in June. So maybe help us unpack sort of the sources of where are you guys seeing some of the deposit outflows, the mix between interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing, any comments on kind of how the things are standing so far in the third quarter? And any sort of broader commentary you might have around where deposit levels could ultimately trough?",neutral,0.0627,0.0682,0.869
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So I'll give you some thoughts. You don't hesitate if you want us to touch on a different component of it. And first of all, just taking a longer-term perspective, deposits have been strong since the beginning of the pandemic, including relative to peers in the industry. So the institutional channel has defined in the last few months, but it appears that we just -- we may have peaked later. 
Since -- if you go back to the beginning of the pandemic, our deposits are still up meaningfully. We started the pandemic at about $90 billion and you see now we're around $130 billion. So going forward, the strategy is very consistent, remain focused on retail and operational institutional deposits. 
The retail deposits are effectively all operational, so our second quarter deposit volumes were down 6.5%. But let's -- I want to unpack where those subchannels came from. So first of all, more than half of that decline was in nonoperational financial deposits. Generally, that is the most rate-sensitive channel by far. It's also the fastest declining category for us. It was down over 11%. 
The second fastest category of decline was actually other nonoperational deposits, which declined about 5%. And so if you focus on the wealth channel and the institutional deposits that are operational, the decline was just 3%. And another dynamic to think about is that within that period, we had tax payments. And so you'd expect some decline alone just coming from that. 
So I think that just highlights the focus on the fact that the vast majority of the decline has come in nonoperational. And then I think you wanted to get a sense of where we are in the quarter. Even at this point, deposits have been down from the average of second quarter, but they seem to be leveling off. The decline that we saw in second quarter was actually largely just in the month of May. And since then, deposits have stabilized at about $120 billion. So that's a lot, but I'll stop there, but that should hopefully give you a good sense of how deposits have been trending.",negative,0.0252,0.9159,0.0589
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Great. And is it fair to assume that the outflows that you guys have seen, albeit smaller outflows so far in the third quarter are also nonoperational? And is there a way to frame where you guys think the total size of nonoperational deposits kind of bucket is? And how much of that could ultimately still leave?",neutral,0.0629,0.1352,0.802
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"So I'll answer the first, which is just what we've seen so far this quarter, 85% of that has been nonoperational. So there's strong continuing of that theme that those deposits are not operational. We haven't talked externally about the mix of operational and nonoperational deposits. And so we can think about that and whether in future quarters, we want to do it unless -- but I think that's a lot for you guys to be able to work from at this point. 
Mark Bette 
And this is Mark. And as a reminder, the nonoperational deposits wouldn't all be at risk. I mean we had plenty of them before the pandemic. And so -- but that is where we've seen the flows -- the movement so far.",neutral,0.0713,0.034,0.8946
0,Operator,,We can go to Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.,neutral,0.0335,0.0277,0.9388
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"I wanted to start off with a question on the NIM outlook. Just looking at last rate cycle, your NIM peaked somewhere in the low 1.60s. Saw a nice uplift this quarter. And with loans composing a similar percentage of the balance sheet today versus last cycle, you have the benefit of higher terminal Fed funds, higher non-U.S. rates contributing as well. Is it reasonable to expect higher NIMs this cycle? Any way you could help us frame how you think about peak NIM potential given some of those tailwinds?",neutral,0.2659,0.0201,0.714
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So one, you're absolutely right. If you go back to mid-2019, even if you look inside 2019, we were over 1.60 in the middle of that year. And you're highlighting the right things to look on mix, there's no reason we shouldn't achieve or frankly, surpass that level. The only caveat would be if you saw a very significant change in the yield curve, but we're not anticipating that. So no reason why we couldn't achieve or surpass that 1.60-ish level. 
And then just as you're thinking about the starting point, though, we gave you that number about -- it was $6 million or $7 million in interest income that came from recovery of those nonaccrual loans. And so the starting point should be not one -- it's a little nip, but it shouldn't be 1.35. Think about it more at 1.33, 1.32. And then betas is another thing that would be helpful maybe to give you just so you can work the models better for second quarter, betas are right at 25%. And as we're looking into third quarter, the betas could be twice that, but not 100%. And so we're still seeing attractive increase. 
And I'm glad you asked about that because we had on deposit levels and then NIM. And so we're trying to give you both volumes and betas. So that at least gives you the building blocks to work from as you're thinking about modeling NII going forward?",neutral,0.1478,0.0293,0.8229
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"And just for my follow-up on capital, you've noted in the past that you want to run with capital levels that are consistent with your GSIB peers despite the lower reg requirements. And given some of the AOCI volatility that we've seen as well as the strong loan growth, which has certainly consumed some capital of late, I was hoping you could provide some updated thoughts on how you're thinking about target CET1 whether that 10% to 11% range is something you're comfortable running at? And just how it informs your appetite to potentially accelerate buybacks, especially if other categories like lending potentially begin to slow in a rising rate backdrop?",neutral,0.2238,0.0223,0.7539
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"You're right in that we -- just competitively, we like to have a strong position relative to the GSIB peers. And I always say when clients are depositing $100,000, they -- those deposits are insured usually by the FDIC. When they're depositing $100 million or $1 billion, they're effectively lending money to us and we want to reflect that our balance sheet is strong and so we look at that closely. 
We look at the CET1 as importantly, which you highlighted, but also the leverage ratio. And so looking at those in conjunction, we look good on a relative basis and obviously, plenty of room relative to any regulatory limits. But we'll continue to look at where things are competitively. And we'll also continue to look at what opportunities we have and the returns on buyback versus what opportunities we're seeing, the loan growth we had, we were very deliberate in looking at what the returns on that growth are. 
And we also talked about the spikiness of loan volume and other activity. Even right now, currency markets moving aggressively, has an impact on FX positions, which has an impact on what our RWA looks like. So all these things come into play. But in general, we feel good about the capital levels. But you've got to also note, we have historically been in a higher range.",neutral,0.226,0.0201,0.754

Thanks, Steve.",neutral,0.2008,0.0161,0.7831
0,Operator,,The next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.,neutral,0.0272,0.0829,0.8899
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"So in the quarter, obviously, the operating leverage is welcome. But we know what's coming with the lag deposit pricing on lower fees. So I wonder if you could give us any thoughts on expenses on a go-forward basis. I know on any given quarter, you'll have ups and downs. But just your thoughts on the jumping off point for expenses and then the possibility of  operating leverage on the full year. I know it's a moving part -- moving boat right now.",neutral,0.0982,0.0566,0.8451
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. Well, you're right that it's hard to look in a quarter. And in this year, it's even hard to think too aggressively about operating leverage for the full year. If you think about what's happening and the influence of rates, it has a big impact on net interest income, that's coming over time, it comes over quarters. 
The impact on expenses is happening more quickly. And so we can't get too excited about the net interest income coming, but we've got to stay focused on expenses. But let me walk through a little bit on the expense side and just give you a couple of highlights. And if you want us to drill in further, we can. 
So first, and it relates to inflation, let's talk about compensation. And so for the quarter, just a couple of comments, and I'll give you a bullet point or 2 on third quarter. The base pay adjustment came into play in third quarter in fall. And that's in and of itself $20 million lift quarter-over-quarter. It's usually half that amount. And then head count was higher and we also had some off-cycle adjustments, which brought in another, call it, $10 million. 
Currency helped significantly, call it, $5 million to $10 million. And then -- but a big component is the cash-based incentive accrual. And so I think sometimes people forget, as we do better, even in a category like NII, we're going to have higher CBI accrual coming along with it. And so that's something that's really important to think about. 
The second category on expenses that I'll call out is equipment and software because that was a big -- that was a $10 million lift just quarter-over-quarter. And we mentioned it in the last conference that we were going to have about a $5 million lift in amortization alone that's coming through, we'll have another sequential lift going into third quarter. 
And then the other component that we experienced in second quarter, in addition to the increase in amortization, is just software rental and support costs are higher. And some of that is inflationary, some of it is just our consumption is higher. But we are, at this point, anticipating another similar rise. And so just looking into third quarter, you'd see a similar step-up potentially from second to third quarter than what we experienced in first to second quarter. So those are the 2 big categories within expenses that I'd call out at this point.",neutral,0.2359,0.0806,0.6835
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Okay. That is definitely helpful. I appreciate it. And maybe just a quick follow-up to the previous combo on deposits and NII. Just curious, it might be a timing thing. You made the point, obviously, that your investment portfolio turns over time, so you get the NIM benefit of higher rates over time. Can you grow NIM from here in the near term if betas are doubling? Just curious how to think about that in the short term?",neutral,0.2273,0.017,0.7557
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. Definitely. And the power of rates going up on where we are. And if you look at just the way the balance sheet is naturally positioned and loans are high -- probably 75-ish percent floating and then even a big chunk of the securities portfolio reprices within a year and then obviously, the cash position is short. And so the asset side is significantly floating. 
And so even if we give up just half the increase on the deposit side, then we still have plenty of room to grow NIM and NII significantly on -- in a rising rate environment even from here.",neutral,0.3177,0.0316,0.6507
0,Operator,,The next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.,neutral,0.0242,0.0806,0.8952
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"Part of your NII guide, I guess, higher, but you're -- I guess you're not telling us how much higher because you tell us your sensitivity to lower stock markets, the impact on fees, but you're not giving us the NII guide. But I guess you're giving us some building blocks. But one component is loan growth and it's up 12% year-over-year. And one reason some investors hold Northern stock is because it's perceived as a safe haven during a recession, your loan losses tend to be a fraction of the industry. 
So my question to you is, what are you seeing in the loan growth, especially among your retail customers? How much appetite do you have to expand that? Are you noticing some more competition because some of your peers are mentioning this more vocally about being a growth area. And does Northern experience recession, if we were to have one because the clients are such high end?",neutral,0.1584,0.0356,0.8061
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So a few things there. On loan growth, the rate should definitely slow relative to what we experienced over the last 2 years. The last 2 years, that growth was highly initiative driven. We had a plan to communicate more with our clients, tell them that we wanted to be there more in their journey of investing more in their businesses. And we wanted to be -- being a liquidity provider isn't just taking deposits, it's also loan, it's also creating loan opportunities for clients when they need it. 
The growth has been very largely in the -- in that type of channel. And the quality in our appetite has not changed at all. And we were extremely deliberate in saying our appetite from a credit quality perspective was not changing. And if you look at some of the -- even the numbers are on credit quality at this point nothing's changed. All of the increases we had this quarter were in the inherent reserves, not specific reserves. 
We actually had net recoveries again, a small amount. And so all early signs are very good. And that gets into your last question was which is do we have a recession and do we have loan issues in a recession? We don't want to proclaim victory before something like that happens. But at this point, all the indicators are what -- are look good and we haven't changed our appetite and what we brought on.",neutral,0.1612,0.0745,0.7643
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"And I'm going to ask one more really big picture question. Maybe this is for you, Mike. But one concern about going into a recession is the negative wealth effect. And since you deal with the highest end customers, especially the Family Offices and like, what's the behavior of your customers after such decline in their personal net worth?",negative,0.0161,0.8802,0.1036
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"You're exactly right, Mike, that, that portion of our client base does have different dynamics to it. And so we're coming off of a time period where as we know, not only did we see asset values increase significantly but also, as we've talked about in previous calls, the opportunity to monetize assets, if you will, meaning sell businesses or real estate or whatever it may be, also was at a very high level. 
And so that dynamic clearly has changed as we've seen. So you see it in the sense of market activity as far as IPOs and things like that going down. And as much as -- there's still plenty of private equity capital that's out there and looking to do transactions, valuations are lower, and that changes their attitude about whether now is the right time to sell that business. 
That said, the position that a lot of these clients are in is that they've had a high level of liquidity. And so when they see the markets go down, they are in a position to be very long-term investors. And so we see a lot of those clients actually deploying capital into the markets at this point. So investing that liquidity that they've raised in the previous phase. 
Now as you move forward from that, beyond having no idea where markets go, et cetera. But just to your point on the wealth effect, there's no doubt that our business benefits when the overall wealth is increasing and accumulating their markets are robust. So that is a better environment for us. We think that it's more resistant on the downside of it as well. But all the same, it's at a lower level than when things are so good. So hopefully, that addresses your macro question.",neutral,0.2404,0.065,0.6946
0,Operator,,The next question comes from Michael Brown of KBW.,neutral,0.0269,0.0582,0.9149
25,Michael C. Brown,,"So the AUCA decline was a bit greater than we were expecting this quarter and above some of your peers on a sequential basis. Can you just expand on some of those key drivers? I mean you called out that you had some wins intra-quarter. But was there any material lost business? Or is it truly just FX in markets that hit the AUCA levels this quarter? 
Mark Bette 
Mike, just to confirm, did you say AUCA, the assets under custody/administration?",negative,0.0585,0.6082,0.3333
25,Michael C. Brown,,"Yes. 
Mark Bette 
Okay. Yes.",neutral,0.0737,0.0237,0.9025
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"I can take it and you add anything you'd like, Mark, but nothing significant from a flow perspective to call out that -- so if I look at it just mathematically, FX was -- so currency translation was a 2.5% hit and market levels, another 8. And so the vast majority of the movement you see was in those 2 factors, but the core business, nothing to note from a flow perspective.",neutral,0.0757,0.0498,0.8745
25,Michael C. Brown,,"Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, one of your peers talked about a plan to reprice certain aspects of their servicing business, and they talked about areas that are experiencing greater wage pressure and capacity constraints. Just curious, is this a dynamic that you guys are seeing? And is there any opportunities to reprice your business higher as you think about the coming quarters or a year with the inflationary pressures that you and the industry are experiencing?",neutral,0.1779,0.0468,0.7752
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"Why don't I take that, Michael. So I would say that we tend to approach the client relationships a little bit different, I think, than differently than some of our competitors. And what I mean by that is, on an ongoing basis, we look to make sure that we have a, I'll call it, balanced relationship or one that is generating value for both the client and ourselves. 
And there are a lot of dynamics to the relationships that we have with our clients, meaning that we're providing a lot of services that we're paid a fee for, there's a lot of other activity, whether it's balances or FX and things like that, that we're doing that the nature of the compensation, the revenues are different. 
And so it's always kind of shifting. And sometimes it can go more or less to 1 side with particular clients, and we like to be in dialogue with them. That doesn't always involve a change in the fee, up or down. It can be a change in the level of activity that we're doing with them, that they do leave more balances with us or do other things. 
And so it's just -- it's a different approach. And I would say, less programmatic about going out at a particular time and looking to necessarily increase fees. And as we know, just over time, because the asset levels have gone up, that's why there is more pressure on the fee side of the equation to come down over time. When you have periods like this with inflation, I think you do see less of that activity Because all the players are in the same position. 
So a client or prospect going out to put their business out to bid, so to speak, is less likely to get aggressive bids by multiple parties in this type of environment than they would in others. So I would say there's no doubt that, as you can see, we're feeling the impact of inflation on the expense side. We get a benefit in the sense of interest rates are higher. So that's a little bit of a hedge, if you will, that's built into our financials and then just something that we look at over longer periods of time.",neutral,0.0855,0.0908,0.8237

6,Brennan Hawken,,"And I'd also like to say congrats to Mark. It's been a real pleasure working together. Always helpful to talk to you, and wish you the best of luck. 
Mark Bette 
Thanks.",neutral,0.1955,0.0154,0.789
6,Brennan Hawken,,"So curious, you guys gave a lot of color on the nonoperating deposits and the runoff and kind of comparing that to how the operating deposits look. But I -- and it was clear that the deposits were under pressure, but the NIM was really good this quarter. So what I'm hoping to understand, and maybe you could give us a bit of a comparison. 
Can you help us frame what the spreads look like for nonoperating deposits versus operating deposits? I think that might help when we try and frame not just what mechanically the deposits might and the balances might look like but really how that might actually triangulate the NII?",neutral,0.1025,0.023,0.8745
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes, absolutely. So one, just a couple of things at a high level, then I'll dig in a little bit. So I mentioned I think 75% of the loans were repriced within 90 days. And even the securities portfolio, about 1/3 of those are floating. And then the cash portfolio, obviously, is very short. Those are the 3 big categories. And it's interesting because in nonoperational deposits, and that's why I specifically separated the financial versus the nonfinancial. 
The most extreme case of something where you have to stay liquid with the deposit is a nonoperational financial services channel deposit. You really can't go -- you really can't invest that long. And so that just -- that stays effectively overnight and it largely. There are exceptions, but largely. And that's part of the reason why if you see our -- the deposits come down, I talked about the fact that they were largely nonoperational. And that's why you saw the decline on the earning assets come largely from our cash position. 
And so you can see what the yields are in the cash position. And if you think about the cost on the nonoperational deposits, again, highly rate sensitive. And in many instances, those clients are saying, it's Fed funds minus something. And so it's tight. Those spreads are tight. And then if you work towards operational deposits, those are ones that, by nature, you know you're able to invest longer. And so those are -- there's a component of it that you have to keep liquid. You have to maintain liquidity for. 
But generally, that's what's going to be represented in the longer duration of the securities portfolio. And in today's environment, where those are repricing and we're waiting anxiously for the host to mature. But it just gives you a sense that those spreads are actually likely going to increase over time. So first of all, those clients tend to be -- those are transaction accounts. They tend to be less spread sensitive, and we've got opportunity to invest them longer. And so that's why we keep emphasizing this distinction between the operational and nonoperational or transactional and nontransactional because the economics underneath them are very, very different.",neutral,0.0746,0.1283,0.7971
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Right. okay. That's -- it's really important and thanks for laying that out, Jason. It sounds like there's a big difference in between the economics. I guess my follow-up would be on beta  So you talked about the beta increasing in the third quarter. Number one, that's a third quarter beta commentary to roughly 50%, not a cumulative, right? So we would be not necessarily looking to get the whole cumulative up to 50%. And then does that increase in beta also contemplate the reduction in these far more rate-sensitive nonoperating deposits running off? 
And maybe how much are those nonoperating, more rate-sensitive deposits pressing that beta higher? Are they the largest contributor? And as they continue to run off, will that help to contain continued increases in beta? Sorry, it's a multipart, but...",neutral,0.2268,0.0879,0.6852
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"That is multi, multipart. But so let me give you a couple of thoughts, but don't hesitate if I -- we want to be helpful as you guys are thinking this through. So don't hesitate to clarify anything. So let me try to work backwards. I may not get all the way back to the beginning. Yes, to the extent that the nonoperational deposits are the ones that continue to run off faster that insulates betas a little bit. 
And then secondly, as we provided some commentary on what betas look like in the third quarter, yes, that is incremental within the quarter. But that's us leaning in, in the sort of trying to be helpful to uncertainty. We just don't -- a lot of what we're doing is just trying to hold on to those deposits -- those operational deposits because we feel they're so volatile. And so we're not starting from we want our betas to be 50%, and we'll see what deposits hold in. It's -- we're talking with clients, telling them we want to be the liquidity partner for them. And so we're going to, in large ways, at this point in the cycle, we're going to follow what we see out there to make sure that for those valuable operational deposits, we maintain deposit levels.",neutral,0.1105,0.0297,0.8599

37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. But again, that's -- a lot of uncertainty in what that's going to look like.

Is it based on the current mix? Or has that nonoperating piece winds down, does that ease the upward pressure on the beta, you know what I mean, it could allow for some better beta outcomes than you're thinking?",neutral,0.1819,0.0871,0.731

7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"I also echo my comments for Mark as well. It's been great working with you. So also best of luck. I think Brennan got my multiparts on the deposit betas as well. So I'll move over to expenses. And the only other two categories -- again, Jason, thanks so much for the granular color there. The only other two categories I just wanted to get a comment on was the typical seasonal lift that we see in outside services in the second half of the year, whether you think that's likely to repeat as it has in the past? 
And then on the other expense line, in lieu of having the Golf open, I know you've wanted to reallocate those expenses to marketing initiatives. Is that also a second half event like the Northern Open was or have you done those over the course of the year, so we shouldn't see as much of a spike up?",neutral,0.164,0.026,0.81
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"All right. So on -- let me start on outside services. So yes, there tends to be a second half lift there. We don't expect it to be that dramatic at this point. In this quarter, it was -- we actually -- remember, a lot of the expenses there are actually volume related. And so it's related to -- you guide market data and other transaction-related services. There's other items that are very volume related. And frankly, some of it is market level related. And so that's something to just keep in mind that can dominate the seasonality component of that line item. 
And so in the second quarter, volumes were down slightly, and that was fully offset by a little bit higher consumption level in consulting and legal. And so as we go into third quarter, we'd actually -- those 2 dynamics are probably still at play. And we'll see which ones as we get further into the quarter, which one wins out. And then on marketing rate, Mike, do you want to talk about that for a minute?",negative,0.0253,0.78,0.1947
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"Sure. Just on the marketing, Brian, yes, we're spending that, if you will, throughout the year. So there's no seasonality -- major seasonality like you had with the Golf tournament. And as we've talked about before, it's less about 1 particular area and more just doing marketing within the 3 businesses.",neutral,0.0361,0.0521,0.9118
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"That's great color. And then maybe, Mike, if I could just follow up on alternatives. I think you mentioned that in your prepared remarks briefly. But if you could just characterize the -- what you're seeing from your wealth client base in terms of demand for illiquid products, both private equity, private credit impact funds? And to what extent you've added those products onto your platform? 
And clearly, it's a great way to retain clients given their interest in that. But maybe just also share if you think that can also have a revenue impact for Northern Trust, even if you're not managing them, but rather having them on your shelf, so to speak?",neutral,0.1885,0.0094,0.8021
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"You described it well as far as our approach there, which is we want to be able to provide the full set of alternatives for our clients. And yet provide the added value, if you will, certain particular funds that we can offer for them and then funds that we manage on our own or through vehicles on our own. 
And so within Wealth Management, for the platform, you kind of hit on some of the areas that are of greatest interest right now like private credit. And so it's a much broader set than maybe it was years ago as to alternatives. When somebody says alternatives used to mean that hedge funds or PE. Now it's a much broader set of the types of products that they would have there. 
And then also, my comment around the growth was particularly related to 50 South Capital, which is within Asset Management, where we offer funds of funds. And there, again, we've seen strong interest on the part of our clients to have that type of more diversified exposure to alternatives. 
And you're right, it has the benefit certainly from a return perspective for our clients. But from our perspective, it is something that has a more attractive financial profile for us and one that further cements the relationship that we have. So we expect -- although there's always ups and downs and volatility with the various categories, but longer term still that alternatives will be an area of growth.",neutral,0.164,0.0118,0.8242

12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Just a one more follow-up on the earning asset side. Just given rising rates in the OCI, can you talk us through about where your securities portfolio duration is and what you're seeing on incremental pickups of new pickups relative to the roll-off on the back end? And just how you're thinking about mixing the portfolio and protecting OCI from here?",neutral,0.107,0.0199,0.8731
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So a couple of thoughts. One, duration overall, duration is down to about 2.6 from 2.7. And then secondly, just from a reinvestment perspective, we're just that fact alone indicates we've been going shorter. And as we're reinvesting maturities that are maturing, we're leaving that powder dry effectively for the time being given a couple of dynamics. One, just the significant volatility in the markets and then secondly, anticipating higher rates. And so we've very much been not reinvesting longer on the curve at this point. And then what was the second part?",negative,0.0355,0.6179,0.3466
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"The second part was just related to capital on the earlier question just about OCI. And have you been moving things from AFS to HTM? Are you rethinking at all, to your prior point about changing duration, how you protect incremental AFS from here? And I guess, just how would you expect the existing OCI to kind of return back into capital over time? So just all things related to OCI management.",neutral,0.0522,0.031,0.9168
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. A couple of thoughts there. One is, we did move about $7 billion from AFS to HTM. And we did that post quarter close actually. And the future impact is that, that should be -- that should protect about half of the exposure we have had on from an OCI perspective. And then in terms of return, it should be about 3.5 years total for us to recoup, maybe a little bit longer to recoup that. But it gives you an overall general sense of what the trajectory looks like.",neutral,0.1253,0.0179,0.8567

5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"A couple of questions. One, a little nit-picky, but on the average balance sheet, I think you show what the yields are obviously by asset class. And I'm just wondering, repo yields went up. It looks like your repurchase agreements went up about 2 percentage points Q-on-Q. And I wanted to make sure I understood that. 
Mark Bette 
Yes, Betsy, part of that -- this is Mark. Part of that was a -- there's a footnote, I think, on our reports that kind of talk about netting change that we made. And those yields, I think it's both on the asset side and the liability side. And the yields would have been, for instance, on the asset side, trying to find that line, which is reported as [ 231 ] I think it would have been around 70, I believe. But there is -- so it was really driven by this kind of gross to net change, both on the asset and liability side.",neutral,0.0711,0.0471,0.8818
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. So any details there we can do off-line. The second question is just, as we look at the 10-Q analysis regarding rate sensitivity and impact of 100 bps parallel shift versus what we got this quarter. Obviously, this quarter was a much bigger benefit than what the Q would suggest. And I just want to make sure I understand the differences of what the assumptions are in the Q that we see versus what happened in the real world? 
Mark Bette 
Yes. I mean I guess one thing I would say is in the Q, it's a model process, and it does look at the forward curve, and it's really a shock movement away from the forward curve. So I know that I think from beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, there was a move from the forward curve, but probably not in the same magnitude of how it would have been modeled within the Q. And so it's a directional guide, I mean the base case is what is not there, which is what the forecast is with the forward curve. But -- so I don't know if that helps, Betsy.",neutral,0.0767,0.0493,0.874
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"And timing matters a lot, too. I mean we came into the quarter with some lift from where rates were prior and  then we also had mix was another benefit of probably 8 basis points alone just by higher mix in the balance sheet. And so there are other dynamics that came into play. And frankly, back to when you're doing those shock scenarios, you're making assumptions around beta, you're making assumptions of a bunch of different things, but it's not in reality. This doesn't always play out that way. And the beta is at 25% for us were low. And we also had movements in other currencies. And so a lot of things at play that led to the increase in NIM.",neutral,0.1904,0.0588,0.7509
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then just lastly, I know at the beginning of the call, you mentioned that nonoperational deposit outflows look like they've stabilized. And I guess my question is, how do you feel your nonoperational deposit -- depositors are behaving? In other words, we're about to get another 75 bps next week. And do you feel that they are optimizing for their -- over this next 6 months already? Or do you feel like they optimize each time the Fed's moving? In other words, I'm wondering if we should be expecting another outflow as the Fed continues to jack up rates here.",neutral,0.2379,0.0736,0.6885
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"I think that channel of depositors disproportionately relative to others have relationships at multiple institutions. And cash doesn't have a long-term commitment on it, and they're able to seek yield when it's important to them. And I'm glad you asked the question because I don't want the interpretation to be that we don't want nonoperational deposits. 
Oftentimes, those deposits are tied to broader relationships. Sometimes we do want those deposits for various reasons. The reason that we're highlighting the distinction is just the economics and the behavior of those deposits is very different.

39,Jeffery J. Harte,,One question left for me. How do you expect funding costs on non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits to move with the ECB hiking?

We understand that we were negative, but when do we get out. And that's the one channel where we expect that to be aggressive. Mark, what would you -- anything to add there? 
Mark Bette

But we would just expect at this point in the curve for those betas to be quite high. And again, not -- it's 6% of the total. It's not tremendous an impact, but I don't think it's crazy to assume. And again, I'm just speculating, say, 75% to 100%. I don't think it changes the dynamics of the outcome significantly on NII. But it's -- when we say significantly higher, it's not 55 versus 50, it's more like 75, 100 is a safer way to model it.",neutral,0.0713,0.0297,0.8989
0,Operator,,Next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0278,0.0557,0.9165
4,Alexander Blostein,,"I wanted just to get your perspective, maybe top of the house view on operating leverage. And over the years, we've kind of gotten accustomed to thinking about operating expenses as a percentage of fees, and obviously, quarter-to-quarter, that will move around and you guys gave some explicit guidance, I guess, for a couple of line items. So really just kind of want to zoom out and think about in an environment we're in today, where the markets are a little choppier, I guess, to say the least and inflation is rising, what is the new normal for that expense to fee ratio over the next, say, a year or 2, right? 
So clearly, you guys are highlighting that some of the higher NII will show up in comp with respect to, I guess, incentive-based compensation. So that will, I guess, also pressure that expense to fee ratio. So helping just kind of think through that is like if we live in a [ 1.05 ] but we're now thinking like [ 1.10 ] plus  and are there any expense initiatives that you guys are starting to contemplate beyond 2022? It feels like the budgeting for this year has sort of left the station. But any incremental thoughts there would be helpful.",neutral,0.1168,0.0471,0.836
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"Sure. Alex, it's Mike. So the way that we're thinking about it is that, as you pointed out, a number of factors on both the revenue side and on the expense side that we want to be in the range for a pretax margin of kind of that mid -- low to mid-30s.  That's the type of range that gets us at the higher end of our ROE target as well. So that's what we're shooting for. 
And then you're exactly right. We're also looking at that expense to trust fee ratio, which has a different set of dynamics to it and has more pressure on it when you have markets going down and inflation. But that's not a reason to say that we're not focused on trying to keep that in the range that we've been in. 
So that is kind of the -- whether it's [ 1.05 ] plus or minus around that, that's where we're trying to keep it because our view is that over time, that's a better, more stable level or measure of our profitability for the business. So that's what we're looking to do. 
As far as looking at expenses, again, always trying to be focused on that. And I would say, even though you said the train has left the station for this year, we are very much focused on getting productivity in all the businesses, but particularly in the Asset Servicing business. 
And so those initiatives were very much in place at the beginning of the year and we're executing on those. And as we do next year, there will be a new set of initiatives around how we get greater scale and efficiency in the company, but particularly in that business.",neutral,0.1651,0.0292,0.8056

10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"You guys may have touched on this, and I apologize if you did and I missed it on your call. But obviously, you're talking a lot about betas with deposits with rates going higher. Have you guys been able to map out or build models to see what impact the full-blown quantitative tightening will have on deposit flows at your organization? 
You figure they're going to reach what, $95 million -- $95 billion a month coming up soon here. And we really haven't gone through this before, we're in uncharted territory. So how do you guys approach that?",neutral,0.1079,0.0541,0.838
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"We have modeled it. We've looked back to see what correlation there is. And I have to say the takeaway is it's not -- our client base just doesn't -- it's not granular enough to say that there's a strong correlation between what the modeling spits out. And you think about a $130 billion deposit base, we have clients that have $10 million, $50 million, $100 million, $200 million, some super large institutional or even wealth -- or even Global Family Office clients to be over -- sometimes over $1 billion. 
And -- so it's just -- it's very spiky, and it's hard to throw a correlation out publicly at what those models spit out. I think what's -- the one thing I think it's instructive to think through is that a lot of our clients think about cash as an asset allocation output. And so one of the things to think about is you're predicting where even core operational transactional deposits will look like is what are overall asset levels and what are market levels because our clients consistently think about liquidity as an asset allocation tool and probably less affected in a predictive way by what's happening at the macro level by the Fed.",neutral,0.0495,0.0702,0.8803

We feel fine, and again, we've got plenty of room from a regulatory perspective, and we feel good how we look on a competitive basis. 
And we've always said it's a combination of different factors. We have very good conversations with our Board about how we want to position capital levels. But we feel good where we are and always want at the same time, take advantage of any opportunities in the market to grow the business. And sometimes that means just what we did with loans a couple of years ago. And we made a big investment there from a capital perspective in the form of higher RWA exposure.

And so I'll give you a sense of -- first, I'll give you a sense of how -- where we are relative to others. First, a high percentage of our income is from Wealth Management, and that's predominantly a domestic business, which comes with a higher tax rate. 
Two, even within the domestic exposures, we're in Illinois, California and New York, we're in high tax states. Then a lot of our -- we've got less benefits from tax credit investments. And another dynamic is we've got less income from tax-exempt income. 
And then more of a nuanced but important factor is there are limitations on U.S. foreign tax credits. And that's actually increasing in our difference relative to our peers. And so those are at least a half dozen things that are -- that they get to vast majority of the reason why there's a difference. 
Going forward, there are things that we can look at and try and implement to try and get that tax rate down. And so we're not  [ just resting ] on that as a fait accompli we -- it's something that we want to work on over time.",neutral,0.0971,0.0422,0.8607
