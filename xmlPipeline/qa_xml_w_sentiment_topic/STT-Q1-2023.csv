0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.,neutral,0.0323,0.0347,0.933
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Just wanted to follow up on the NII side of things. So Eric, maybe you can just kind of walk through how much of that 5% to 10% in the second quarter is simply the averaging act? And also just you made a point in a release about how [indiscernible] had increased significantly in the early March to the end, what we think about in terms of your expectations for deposit growth, both on an end-of-period and average basis going forward as well?",neutral,0.1164,0.0332,0.8504
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Ken, it's Eric. The largest driver of our NII trends right now, whether it's the fourth quarter or the first quarter or first quarter to second quarter, is really the level of noninterest-bearing deposits. Those came down this past quarter about $5 billion. We had expected them to come down about $3.5 billion. And we do a fair amount of forecasting on this. If you think about January, February, March, it usually comes through in a U-shape, and we actually had some of the opposite play through in March. And so that's what's been driving some of the change in NII. And in contrast, we've actually seen good flows in interest-bearing deposits at the same time. So there's a fair amount going on under the surface. 
As we look into second quarter, we expect this pace of noninterest-bearing deposits to continue -- to continue to rotate. So if you step back last year, we had periods where noninterest-bearing deposits were up $1 billion, then down $2 billion, then down $4 billion and down $2 billion, right? It's been quite volatile. And right now, we're expecting noninterest-bearing deposits probably to come down another $4 billion, $5 billion into the second quarter. And if you think about it, when you earn 5% or more for those kinds of deposits on the asset side, and then pay 0. That can be a significant -- that's a significant amount of NII, right? Every $1 billion is worth $12 million, sometimes $15 million per quarter. And so that's what we are seeing flowing through. 
The hard work we're trying to do from a forecasting standpoint, and forecasting is always hard, is where does the trend -- how does the trend play out? And we do some of what you probably do, which is we've looked at the last peak in the last low of noninterest-bearing deposits. The peak was 22%. The last low was 18%. On the other hand, in dollar terms, the last peak was $50 billion, and the last low was about $30 billion and right now, we're sitting at about $39 billion. And so that's what's really playing through the NII forecast. 
And then as we play that out, we expect to see some of that noninterest-bearing deposit rotate into interest-bearing deposits. But to be honest, some of our clients who are sophisticated institutions are also looking at some of the other strong rates that they can get either in treasuries or money market funds. And so at this point in the cycle, with the high level of prevailing rates, we expect deposits probably to trend down another few billion into the second quarter. But this is all kind of dependent on client behavior and activity as we take a look at our forecast.",neutral,0.0546,0.334,0.6114
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Yes, Eric. And just one follow-up to that is just that -- the types of changes in client activity, is this a different behavior than you've seen in the past in terms of where the ins and outs are coming from? I mean, obviously, we're all expecting deposits to come down as were you and then the events of the last month came through. So our clients just making different decisions with what they're doing with their even operational cash? Or how would you kind of describe what's happening across the client base?",neutral,0.0395,0.235,0.7255
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I think clients are -- the clients are making a variety of different decisions here. And I think part of what why we're seeing -- what we're seeing is that we've not lived in an environment where interest rates are at 5%, right, whether you put that at the Fed or in 3- and 6-months treasuries, right? And so clients have a fair amount of alternatives, and they're thinking about how to deploy, how to maximize interest and yields for their own clients, especially the kind of clients we have who are over time will always be price sensitive. 
When it comes to the operational nature of the deposits, you can see from our disclosure, and we added some of this, clients are incredibly sticky and stable from an operational standpoint. Operational deposit balances were steady, and the operational percentages continue to be in a very narrow band. You have clients with several billions of dollars each often, but they typically have hundreds, if not thousands of individual accounts with very significant transactional and payment flows, and that's why they're categorized as operational in nature. And so that behavior hasn't changed. 
What we -- that behavior of core custodial deposits is deeply ingrained in the structure of those accounts, the processing we do for them, the avoidance of overdrafts that they always trying to -- that they don't want to -- that they don't want. I think what we're seeing instead is clients on the margin will find for their discretionary, the last dollar of -- of $100 of deposits, they're going to be rate-seeking. And at these prevailing rates, there's -- they're going to look here and there. Now sometimes, we match them with those rates. So we'll offer deposits at exception rates. Sometimes we help them with their sweeps or some of their treasury repo interest. And so there's a variety of different ways we serve our clients, and we'll continue to do that. But clearly, at this point in the rate cycle, you kind of have some of the patterns that you and we would expect to have.",neutral,0.0583,0.0458,0.8959
0,Operator,,The next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS.,neutral,0.0254,0.0914,0.8832
15,Adam Quincy Beatty,,"This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just a quick follow-up on NII and in particular, the geographic mix of deposits. So you've got kind of fairly steady trends, U.S. kind of going up and a higher beta, as you've called out in the past and then non-U.S. somewhat going down with a lower beta. Just wondering if you expect based on what you're seeing right now with your clients, those trends to continue, in particular, will we continue to see pressure on non-U.S. deposit balances? And could those betas maybe be going up outside the U.S. as you say, the competing yields are somewhat higher?",neutral,0.2245,0.1527,0.6229
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Thanks for the question. I think we'll continue to see a range of behaviors across the geographies. I mean, I think the way I would describe them is in the U.S. with prevailing rates of where they are, you have this noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing rotation on one hand. And then you have clients nudging on pricing in general. And we're kind of at that point where clients now have incentives just like we do to find a place to settle out with us. 
I think in Europe and pound sterling, it's still new, right? We've just been at the kind of the first, maybe half, 2/3 of the rate increases. And there, the betas continue to be in that 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% range and are quite attractive for us. They're good for clients because the clients tend to have somewhat fewer alternatives in those international jurisdictions relative to the U.S. on one hand and on the other, there tends to be a more -- there tends to be less price sensitivity on the deposits. And we do expect that to continue. And I think with more rate increases flowing through in the international jurisdictions, that allow us to continue to lag modestly the deposit rates that we offer to see those play through.",neutral,0.2554,0.0244,0.7202
15,Adam Quincy Beatty,,"Great. That makes sense. And then just turning to the buyback, pretty healthy in the quarter. You still got the kind of not-to-exceed target out there. So just wondering how you're thinking about that in terms of deposit trends and capital needs and whether some of the disruption in the banking backdrop has maybe affected your thinking around the buyback?",neutral,0.1087,0.0834,0.8079
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Good question, and it's something that we've been very deliberate and thoughtful about. You can imagine, as we saw the events in March unfold, we've been thinking daily and weekly about how stable is the broader banking system. The starting point for us is we've got an incredibly strong balance sheet, right? Our capital ratios are in the 12% range. That's 100 basis points above the top end of our range, 200 basis points higher than the bottom of our range. It's 400 basis points above the regulatory requirements, and you know many run much thinner in terms of regulatory requirements. And we've always chosen to run with this kind of -- with a healthy buffer. 
So I think on one hand, the starting point for us is important in our ongoing decisioning around capital return, and we're conscious of that. On the other hand, just like you say, we assess the market conditions in the environment, not for us, because this is not about us, it's about what's happened in some of the other parts of the banking system. We assess those. And if we would had economic and banking conditions like they were at the beginning of March, I think we'd have a -- we'd make different statements around our capital buyback. 
And so we feel like there's been a fair amount of healing since the beginning, middle of March, and we think that gives us that factors into our thinking. And then what we'll do is we'll continue to evaluate conditions, right, if market conditions and systemic conditions get more concerning for the system, we'll -- we may pace these differently if they continue to be at these levels of stability that we're at, we feel confident that we can and should continue to proceed. But it will be a week-by-week reassessment. Our buybacks aren't once and done. They're done over the course of the next 8 to 10 weeks. And this is one of those quarters where you do them more linearly than not. And so we'll evaluate. But our position of strength is just -- I think quite high and gives us a fair amount of latitude.",neutral,0.1532,0.023,0.8239
0,Operator,,The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0229,0.0762,0.9009
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Could we talk a little bit about the expense outlook and how you're thinking about managing it? I know that you mentioned 2Q and -- specifically, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about operating leverage either on a total rev basis or more on a fee basis? I really what I'm trying to get at is how you think about the NII piece as we think about operating leverage for the 2Q and for the full year?",neutral,0.035,0.0335,0.9315
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Betsy, there's a couple of different ways we look at this. And clearly, we're one quarter into the year, we've started to give some outlook for second quarter. And we need to see how the conditions and the environment plays out because equity markets up or down, bond markets up or down by more than a percentage point or 2 is going to impact our revenues. And so I think it's still early in the year. 
We set out this year to drive positive operating leverage and continue to look for ways to do that. But we need more information about the external conditions to really see that. I think as we think about the opportunities here, though, NII will trend positively for the year but not as positively as we would have expected. So that's a consideration. You saw that we took up our fee guide for the second quarter, and so that gives us a little more ballast or breathing room or momentum to be honest. And we'll continue to manage expenses quite actively. 
I would say in the last 1.5 years, as NII was up 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, right, we didn't spend that on the expense line, right? We were quite conscious of continuing to drive investment but also productivity and calibrated in our expense growth. And so as we look forward, we'll continue to do that. But obviously, with -- we'll keep track of the direction of revenues and obviously try to adapt where we can.",neutral,0.3493,0.0359,0.6148
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,And then just a quick follow-up on the other fee line that you discussed the $50 million increased Q2. Could you just give us a sense of how we should think about the trajectory of that? Are you going to be increasing your investment into renewables and so that should be a growing line in line with increase in investments to renewables? Or is that a onetime step up? And that's -- just a little color there.,neutral,0.2471,0.0121,0.7408
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. It's -- the revenue impact on that line is a little bit of both, and we're still discerning all the specifics and doing the forecasting. In second quarter, we have -- we need to do a year-to-date catch up. That's how the accounting guidance is written and then there will be some additional revenues in the third and fourth quarter, not as much as there would be from the second quarter catch-up. 
So we're trying to map that out. And as the quarter proceeds, we'll try to get a little more guidance out. But that line will tend to have -- instead of kind of being centered around 0 will be centered around a slightly higher number in the coming quarters. And we'll try to get some guidance out on that as we go through all the forecasts.",neutral,0.1106,0.0372,0.8522
0,Operator,,The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.,neutral,0.0249,0.0655,0.9097
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Eric, can you share with us how you guys are investing your cash in your securities portfolio in terms of durations that you're looking at? Are you trying to shorten the duration of the portfolio as you reinvest the cash proceeds that come off of every quarter? What's your thinking about that?",neutral,0.03,0.053,0.917
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Gerard, it's Eric. We're -- we've been quite careful over the years of running a portfolio with a modest amount of duration. I think it's typically in the 2.5 years to 2.8 years and in that -- that provides us some amount of benefit from what historically has been steepness in the yield curve. It's also given us some ability to create some amount of stabilization in NII without taking the opportunity to benefit from interest rate rises, which is what we've been able to do over the last 2 years. 
We like that amount of duration because it also protects the income statement as rates fall, and we'll see if that -- if there is -- if there are rate cuts late in the year or next year or the year after that. So that gives us some stability as well. I think what I'd tell you, though, is we spend as much time on duration and curve shape as we do on carefully also running some MBS portfolios where there's some additional yield pickup, but you've got to be careful in terms of the level of convexity risk that you take. 
And then because of our deposit franchise, as was mentioned earlier, we're doing this around the globe. We've got about 1/3 of our balance sheets in international jurisdictions, and that gives us real opportunities in pound sterling, euro, Canadian, Aussie dollars, et cetera, to invest. And we may run somewhat different duration levels in those different currencies, we might be shorter in one, longer in other, partly to reflect our views on the rate cycle and where each of those are. So there's a range of kind of approaches that we take there, and we find that our flexibility gives us some opportunities to deliver some good yields in NII, but obviously being careful. We don't want to stretch for duration. We don't want to stretch for yield. We want to continue to run a conservative portfolio like we have for many, many years.",neutral,0.1774,0.0267,0.7958
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Very good. And then just a follow-up on your comments about deposits. I think you said that the low point of non-interest-bearing were at $30 billion, you're sitting at $39 billion now. And 2-part question. If rates just stay here, let's say the Fed doesn't start cutting rates later this year and next year and we get a 4.75%, 5% Fed funds rate. Do you sense that the noninterest-bearing deposits could approach that $30 billion on a go-forward basis? And second, on your operational accounts, do you guys have to pay any interest on those accounts?",neutral,0.0499,0.0562,0.8938
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Let me do that in reverse order. The operational accounts are sometimes interest-bearing, sometimes non-interest-bearing. So there's a wide variety of different pricing structures. But they tend to be -- remember -- and these are thousands of accounts often times -- for each of the asset managers or asset owners that we custody for. And it's less about the pricing in those accounts than about the nature of the accounts and the payment transactions that clients are funding in effect with the deposits that they leave with us. 
In terms of non-interest-bearing deposits, I do think we'll continue to see a trend downwards. We saw a $5 billion trend this past quarter, which was $1 billion or $2 billion more than we had expected even back at that early -- even back when we last gave guidance. We expect probably another $4 billion, $5 billion will come out in the second quarter. And then I think we do believe that there is going to begin to be some stabilization. I'd be inclined to think that we'll get to that $30 billion probably later this year. But this is where there's no amount of crystal balling that we can provide. It's hard to really be sure it could be at that level. It could be around that level. There's -- we've seen movements in non-interest-bearing month by month that are plus/minus $4 billion or $5 billion. 
Even in April, as an example, we've had days where non-interest bearings were in the $44 billion level, so $5 billion above the recent average and days when they were at the $34 billion level. So it's that kind of range and volatility that we're trying to forecast through. But clearly, the trends here, and I think the last benchmark of that -- around that $30 billion level, maybe one that we approach potentially later this year.",neutral,0.0717,0.1387,0.7896
0,Operator,,The next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global.,neutral,0.0244,0.0667,0.9088
49,James Francis Mitchell,,"Maybe just a little bit on the fee income story. You talked about a pretty hefty sequential growth, but not necessarily coming from the servicing line. So -- but you talked about great momentum in servicing and onboarding. So how do we think about the trajectory on the servicing fee line as you onboard? Is it more of a back half story? And how are you thinking about full year with servicing fees?",neutral,0.0898,0.0273,0.8829
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Jim, it's Ron. So maybe I'll start here. On servicing fees, we -- as Eric noted, we do expect growth, and it's driven by a couple of things. One is we've been carrying, for a while now, a fair amount of AUC/A to be implemented. A lot of that was tied to some systems development that needed to occur that is occurring. So we're expecting to see a hefty amount of that AUC/A to get installed. 
Secondly, the wins this quarter were -- while it was a low AUC/A amount, it was much more traditional back office plus this very large alternatives, both of which are easier to install or they take less time to install. So we're actually quite pleased with how 2023 is shaping up from a sales perspective and it's good that it's shaping up early in the year. So with all that, we do expect to have a meaningful amount of servicing fee growth. That, coupled with depending on what you believe about markets tends to wash over everything that I'm talking about. But if you believe that there's some kind of market stability, we feel pretty good about the year as we would look forward.",positive,0.5549,0.0258,0.4193
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"And Jim, it's Eric. Just to round that out, Ron's covered servicing fees -- management fees should give us some lift as well as we have some equity market appreciation -- equity and bond market appreciation into the second quarter. 
I think if you go through the trading lines, second quarter is usually good. We'll have to see just how much volumes play through in spread. So -- but you've seen we've been making nice headway given the market volatility with specials and sec finance that will likely continue. In the software and processing line, we had one of the lowest on-premise renewal quarters this in 1Q. And that one just varies. 
If you just you look at some of the materials in the deck, that could be $6 million, it could be $60 million. That was literally the swing from fourth quarter to first quarter. We expect as we had said some sizable upticks there as well. So there's a range of areas. And in effect, from a management standpoint, we're focused on every one of the opportunities and businesses and harnessing the client momentum that we've been seeing.",neutral,0.3444,0.0885,0.5671
49,James Francis Mitchell,,"Yes, sure, Eric. Yes, I appreciate all that. But in terms of the sequential increase of 4% to 5%, it seems like a lot of it is coming from some of these lumpy revenue streams that don't necessarily continue further out whether it's other kind of catch up, whether it's software processes jumping back. But when we think about sort of the momentum in the back half and that sort of new run rate in the second quarter, is that sustainable as you gain momentum in some of the more annuity-like revenue streams? Or do we kind of have to push out a little longer? I'm just trying to get a sense of beyond 2Q, you have a nice jump in 2Q, but is that really sustainable?",neutral,0.3051,0.0322,0.6627
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. No, I understand the perspective. I think what though, remind you on software and processing, we had an unusually low print in the first quarter. So the first part of the follow-up in second quarter is rebound and then continuation. On-premise revenues have averaged about $30 million a quarter, for example. That's a reasonable kind of average that one could expect, but we printed $6 million this past quarter. So it's that kind of, I think, rebound we're expecting in the second quarter and then it should it should stay within the averages. 
And then beyond that, to your point, there are the more annuity-like areas, whether it's the software-enabled, the SaaS revenues in software, whether it's some of the -- we have very flow-oriented FX and securities finance books. And then as Ron mentioned, we're seeing increasing momentum in servicing fees and management fees, and the servicing fee momentum is spread as we've mentioned, both in terms of back office and in middle office, which gives us additional diversity. 
It's hard for us to predict the second half of the year, and I'll hesitate every April to reestimate the full year. But I think we'll know more as we get to June and July, and I'll certainly give -- be able to give you an indication. But we're certainly seeing momentum of activity with clients and expect some of these on-boardings to come through. And we think that provides a step up and then there should be some continuation beyond second quarter that will be positive.",positive,0.5536,0.0651,0.3813
0,Operator,,"The next question comes from Stephen Chubak of Wolfe Research. 
Unknown Analyst 
This is actually Sharon Long on for Stephen. For NII, I know you noted that you -- it will still be up, but maybe not as meaningfully as the 20% you had guided to you previously. Is there any numbers you can put around that, for example, assuming that the NIB rotation continues as expected, and you get to that $30 billion number sometime in the year?",neutral,0.1322,0.0204,0.8475
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I mean the -- this is where the forecast just have a wide range of outcomes. I think given the first quarter report and what we expect in the second quarter, we don't think that one can reach at up 20% for the full year. I think what we're wrestling with is just what's the pace of rotation and what's the pace of some of the price sensitivity that we see in the U.S. clients at this point in the cycle. And that's what's harder to determine. 
So there's a range of forecasts we have. And if I had to kind of share with you, I'd say if one thinks of it in a more [indiscernible] way and expects more rotation and more price sensitivity, NII could be up 5% to 10% this year instead of 20%. On the other hand, if one is optimistic and believe some of the history, where there is real attenuation in the noninterest-bearing deposits, NII could be up 10% to 15%. So there's a larger range than usual in the forecast that we have. And to be honest, just like I quoted some of the April year-to-date data and the range of levels that we're seeing, we expect that those -- we expect to be -- that there will be quite a bit of range in the outcomes, just really hard to predict but maybe that gives you some perspective. 
It's probably a larger range than you're looking for. But we're trying to be as transparent and forthcoming as we can give the facts and the information that we have here.",neutral,0.1679,0.0368,0.7953
0,Operator,,The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.,neutral,0.0287,0.0631,0.9082
30,Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala,,"I guess just a couple of quick follow-ups, Eric, one on NII. I heard all your comments on the -- in the Q&A. I just sort of make sense of is the customer behavior that surprised you today versus January given that you probably assume that rates were going a little bit higher than where we were back in Jan? Or is it the events of the last month that have changed customer behavior and increase the intensity of repricing?",neutral,0.1961,0.1848,0.6191
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"No, I don't think it's really the events the last month, which are really in very different client segments, different geographies. Those are very different from what we do and who we serve. And we had a little bit of a flight to quality -- not flight to quality, we had a bit of this risk-off sentiment with deposits. But that's just a whole different ecosystem than to those clients that we serve. 
I think what's really happening here and what we've been trying to estimate, but maybe is unestimatable or unforecastable is just how do clients operate when prevailing rates are at 5% in the United States, right? We've not had that scenario in our -- for some of us in our careers, right? But for some of us, going back many, many -- probably 2 decades. And so the data is thin on that question. And I think what we've seen is back in January, when we had given some of our NII guidance for the quarter, just on noninterest-bearing deposits, we had seen one quarter where they were up a little bit, one quarter where they were down $5 billion. And then the third to fourth quarter, they were down $2 billion, right? 
So you're in this situation where you're trying to guess, forecast, estimate we can -- we've got to use all those words. And I think we thought we might have reached some attenuation, but we didn't. There was another step of rotation playing through. It's not a rational for clients to do that. And so they've shifted. Now they shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. They shift across currency sometimes because of their sophistication. I think what's interesting is that we actually got more deposits in the U.S., and we had some outflows in -- or some net reductions in Europe and in Asia. 
And so you kind of have a real mix out there. And I think what we're realizing is all the data sets we have are actually not -- there's not enough data on this question of deposit or, I'll call it, deposit or pricing behavior because that's what this is about. And that's what we're trying to better estimate. But the clients we're serving, we're continuing to serve, the momentum in the business is clear. And just like NII went up faster than we had thought, I think there's a trend here that it's coming down a bit sequentially. It's still going to be up for the full year, but we'll need to see how much.",neutral,0.064,0.3308,0.6053
30,Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala,,"Got it. And just a separate question. I know it's small for you, but the other element that your provision is higher, the credit portfolio rating, remind us of the credit sensitivity that we should expect from the balance sheet from an economic downturn, if there are more rating agency downgrades, like what that means from a credit cost provisioning perspective as we look forward?",neutral,0.1041,0.0386,0.8573
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, it's good question. I mean the -- aside from the provision that's calculated using all the CECL techniques and fairly regimented that we had for that -- for the one cash placement that we made, the provision was about $15 million. I think for us, provisions have been in the $5 million, $10 million, $15 million range typically. We've seen a little bit of migration or change in ratings in a half dozen credits. But it's the kind of thing that plays through. And part of that is we have higher prevailing rates, and that puts a little bit of pressure in different parts of the economy. And I think it's probably fairly typical. 
I think the -- we run quite a high-quality and high-grade lending book. Even where we're a little more down market, we call BB's down market, right? So we have -- we have a ratings distributions that are typically in the A or A- or even better range. So we'll have some sensitivity to economic conditions. You can go back to around the start of COVID, right? The number of banks built reserves that can give you a sense of sensitivity. But what we -- we feel like we're well reserved now given what we know, both on the economic conditions and individual positions that we hold. It's highly diversified. It's high quality. And we'll obviously -- we'll continue to monitor.

I mean, I think I know the answer, but I need you to really explain why this is an earnings issue and not a liquidity issue? And on the earnings issue, just to make sure I heard you correctly, your non-interest-bearing deposits went from $44 billion down to $39 billion. You think base case, it might go down to $34 billion, but the low end of the range, which is possible later this year would be $30 billion. That would be going maybe non-interest-bearing deposits from $44 billion down to $30 billion, that would be $14 billion less than free money. 
You said it was $12 million to $15 million per $1 billion. So just taking the worst case, you go down to the $30 billion. It hurts you $15 million. We're talking about $200 million of earnings lost which might be around 7% or 8% of your EPS, if you look at kind of a run rate sort of thing. So first, is my math correct there that, that is the earnings issue and then reassure if it's appropriate, that this is not a liquidity issue.",neutral,0.0426,0.2781,0.6793
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Mike, why don't I start? I think that as you're calculating the worst case, I think your math roughly is correct. We're doing all we can to avoid the worst case. But I think your math and how you get to the earnings impact is right, assuming the in effect, 100% margin on the deposits. 
In terms of liquidity, there's nothing here that approaches a liquidity issue, right? These are custody deposits. As Eric noted, they're operating deposits. And they give you a sense and a little more explanation of why we've got X number of clients but a multiple number of accounts. And if you think about it, a mutual fund company probably has at least one account per fund they have with us, if not more, it's to actually run their funds. 
If you look at the liquidity coverage ratio, which Eric walked you through, it's up at 124% now. It's actually gone up, not down. So yes, this is an earnings issue and one that we intend to offset to the extent possible with the primary source of our revenue, which is fees as well as continued careful management of expenses.",neutral,0.1782,0.0299,0.7919
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"And then a follow-up to that. You said you're not changing your buyback. So you have $4.5 billion for the year. You've done $1.25 billion. So you have $3.25 billion left with the current market decline, that would be 14% of your market cap. So to the extent you see this as a step down, but not life-threatening, what's your appetite towards completing that buyback? And how soon are you able to enter the market?",neutral,0.0857,0.073,0.8412
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"I mean, Mike, I think Eric explained it well. If you look at our capital levels, and the fact that we held off buying back shares for quite a large amount of -- basically for most of last year. We feel comfortable continuing the buyback. We're obviously conscious of the environment. So we feel comfortable doing that. And we certainly feel comfortable about ourselves, but there is a system in which we live. 
And to the extent to which the system started to look very different from what it is today, look a whole lot more like or even worse than what we saw in March, we're certainly not going to ignore that. But our -- based on what we know now and our financial strength, we think it's actually quite prudent to do so. And our forecasting puts us -- I mean, we don't think about it in terms of market cap, we think about it in terms of what's our CET1 ratio, our capital ratio, and this will still put us above our range. So well within our range. I mean, so this is something that at this point, we feel very comfortable doing.",neutral,0.1831,0.0621,0.7548
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"And Mike, it's Eric. I'd just underscore, right, the capital and liquidity strength and ratios are just incredibly high and cost by every measure that one can see. And we've shared quite a bit of that. And that's the reason why we're comfortable at this point, proceeding with our buyback. We'll -- I said in my prepared remarks, we do it through the rest of the year. I said we do it at pace. And even within a quarter, we typically start buybacks the day after earnings and then we will operate and execute on them, subject to market conditions, of course, but typically execute on them over the 8 to 10 weeks of available days during the quarter. So it's -- we'll -- we've got good confidence in the broader system and enormous confidence in our particular position here. 
On earnings, we'll work through the earnings issue. NII was -- is something that we can figure our balance sheet to earn when rates move up and the balance sheet does give some of that back when rates come down. And we'll obviously continue to drive our focus on fees and manage expenses and drive what really is a multiyear trajectory.",neutral,0.2015,0.0212,0.7773
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"One last time, crystal clear. So there's nothing about the reduction in the ""free money"" non-interest-bearing deposits or anything else in your results that would give you pause to continue buying back your stock?",neutral,0.1249,0.09,0.7851

0,Operator,,The next question comes from Rob Wildhack of Autonomous Research.,neutral,0.0258,0.0818,0.8924
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"I wanted to unpack some of the RWA dynamics in the quarter. RWAs were up 7% sequentially, but the overall balance sheet, I think, was down 3% or 4%. So can you just give us some color on what was going on there?",negative,0.0201,0.8981,0.0818
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure, Rob. It's Eric. And I think there's some materials on RWA, both in the earnings deck on Page 12 and then further back in the addendum. I think if you remember, fourth quarter, we had a particularly low print in RWA, which we had signaled at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Overdrafts came in lower than expected. Some of the risk-weighted assets associated with the FX books came in lower because of the late December move in dollar rates. 
And so we had expected a rebound of about $10 billion, $15 billion of RWA from fourth quarter to first quarter. And you saw we got about $8 billion or $9 billion of that. We still came in a little light on overdrafts, which is fine. Part of that is the amount of cash in the system and the cash and deposits that we're holding on behalf of our clients. You see RWA is still down year-over-year. And that's because of a fair number of optimization efforts. We felt like there's real opportunities for us to grow the franchise on one hand but deploy RWAs in very high quality and higher returning ways on the other and support our clients. 
And so we've been adjusting the deployment across the FX books, you think about how much we want to deploy in the forward space and the long-dated forwards versus spot and securities finance, there are different amounts. But we're quite well off when it comes to capital and our plans here really to continue to find ways to smartly deploy additional capital and additional RWA to drive organic growth.",negative,0.1801,0.6312,0.1887
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,And then I appreciate the color on the to-be installed business and the on-prem enterprise trajectory from here. But could you just remind us how long those installs typically take to convert to revenue?,neutral,0.0962,0.014,0.8898
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. When we described the installation going into the second quarter, we were describing those as realized revenue installations. So in effect, the way the accounting works typically is when we win, we don't book the revenues, but it's only at the installation date that you begin to book them. 
So you'll see both the backlog assets under custody in the second quarter begin to come down and some of the servicing and middle office revenues float upwards. And similarly, for the software and data processing areas, you'll see something in that direction as well.",negative,0.0522,0.5181,0.4297
0,Operator,,The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.,neutral,0.0258,0.0779,0.8963
16,Vivek Juneja,,"A couple of questions. Firstly, CRD revenues. I know you said it should -- Eric, the on-premise revenue should bounce back in the second quarter. But just want to step back and look at it on a full year basis, the entire CRD revenues, what is your expectation at this point for full year growth in that -- looking at all those 3 subcomponents together?",neutral,0.0947,0.0227,0.8826
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I don't -- Vivek, I don't know that we -- in January, we went into that level of detail. I think what we've said in the past is that there's a range of revenue growth in our different fee categories. We've described back office is growing towards the -- traditional back office growing closer to the lower single-digit revenue growth. We described middle and front office, which would include CRD at high single-digit growth. There will be years when it could be double-digit revenue growth. 
So that's what we said about that category, this category. I think what we see in particular, in software is the on-premise revenues over time will -- may not be as heavy. But we do see real momentum in the combination of the software enabled in SaaS. But all in, that should grow in the higher single-digit revenues typically though there'll be some range around that in a given year.",neutral,0.1746,0.0157,0.8096
16,Vivek Juneja,,"Okay. And then going back to this question that's come up on the large amount of new business that remains to be installed in servicing, and you said you should see a pickup in 2Q. Ron and Eric, what's your expectation for how much of that do you expect would get installed over the course of this year, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q? By the time we exit this year, how much should be done. And therefore, what benefit should there be [ defeased ] from that?",neutral,0.1003,0.0173,0.8824
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I think the fact there are a couple of ways to think about that because what happens here is that it gets onboarded in tranches. So we might onboard the assets under custody and administration. But there are multiple services that we're often providing for those assets. So we had a couple of wins over the last year or 2 years with $1 trillion. Those $1 trillion wins would have had some custody, some accounting, they might have had some performance analytics. They would have had some middle office services in many cases because they were Alpha mandates. 
So there's 3, 4 or 5 kind of, I'll call it, revenue installations, right, for each of the balances that sit there when we describe them as assets under custody and administration. I think roughly, our view is that we'd expect about half of the backlog in custody and administration to come through during the course of this year. I'll say that roughly, right? It tends to vary. 
And then the revenue pieces, it won't be quite at that level because the revenues come through over time as you get the different, I'll call it, layers of services that are provided associated with that assets under custody administration. But what we'll do is we'll -- I think it's -- that may be some kind of broad perspective. What we'll try to do each quarter is give you more and more visibility as we get to those implementation points. Because remember, these are implementations where not only have we configured a front-to-back offering that we've -- that we've designed for clients, but clients need to reconfigure many of their processes and systems in parallel with that to adopt. And so it's a joint effort on both sides.",neutral,0.0583,0.0262,0.9156
16,Vivek Juneja,,"If I may sneak in one more, just CF Global. Any color on what that could add to your fee revenue, Eric? And when do you expect that to start to add?",neutral,0.0794,0.0229,0.8977
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I mean, CF Global for us is a very attractive opportunity. We've historically done some outsourced trading over the years in the U.S. and Asia, we weren't particularly large in that space in Europe. This gives us some real heft and credibility in Europe. It's an acquisition that will close likely at the end of the year. So I think it's really a 2024 topic. And we're looking at a business like that between what we have and what we're adding to be in the $30 million to $50 million range of revenues next year and we've got some of that today. But this -- what we purchased in CF Global really is distinguishing in terms of capabilities, product lines lets us build around what we have and then drive some real incremental growth. 
And so something we're very excited about because it fits into being the enterprise outsourcer. You do that for a custody, accounting, middle office, front office, and we do it for the CIOs of small and midsized companies. And it's really -- it fits very well with our positioning and strength.",neutral,0.1728,0.0124,0.8148
