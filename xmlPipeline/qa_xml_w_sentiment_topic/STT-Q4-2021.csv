0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0412,0.0257,0.9332
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So maybe we can start unpacking some of the guidance, and I'm sure there's going to be a good amount of follow-ups on the back of that as well. But maybe just starting with the fee guide, really zoning in on service and fees. State Street has obviously made a considerable amount of improvement in retaining clients and winning new business. So maybe help us unpack within the 2% to 3% growth for the year, what's sort of contemplated from markets in terms of the benefit of the 5% that you guys highlighted earlier? So how much is the market benefit versus the net new business and pricing? 
And I'm assuming BlackRock is included in this guidance as well, but how much of a drag in the servicing fee revenue you guys expect from loss of the BlackRock mandate?",neutral,0.449,0.0191,0.5319
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Alex, it's Eric. Happy New Year to you, too. Let me cover fees and then servicing fees, which I think is where you're focused. Our guide for total fee revenue is up 3% to 4% for the year. Our guide for servicing fee is up 2% to 3%. And obviously, that includes about 1 percentage point of headwind from foreign exchange. So in effect, the servicing fees are up, for example, 3% to 4% in our guide adjusted for currency translation. 
If you think about the drivers, we've factored in all the known events, both our growth, our installations, net new business and so forth. If you want to peel it apart a little more deeply, we start off at a good equity market level, and we expect some year-on-year growth from equity markets. That's probably worth about 2 percentage points of a tailwind to growth. 
Flows and client activity, which are variable, it's probably worth another 1 percentage point and part of our kind of fee structures. Net new business is -- continues to tick up. We expect core net new business to be up 2%, and that obviously includes all the new onboardings offset by any attrition. So that's on a net basis. And then obviously, there's just the usual 2% grind down of pricing. And that kind of gets you to the low end of our range. We think there's some upside, which is why adjusted for currency, the servicing fee guide is in the 3% to 4% range. And what it does is it represents the continued acceleration of our business towards our medium-term targets, which are really in the 4% to 5% range.",positive,0.5606,0.0314,0.408
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Great. That's perfect. And just maybe staying on the topic, but looking at the expense side of the P&L. The 1.5% to 2% growth, I think, is contemplated on, obviously, the fee outlook that you just outlined. If we are in a tougher equity market backdrop and let's say, you guys don't hit the 2% to 3% service and fee growth or the 3% to 4% fee growth, what are sort of the bookends around the expense growth trajectory that we could see this year? So in other words, like, in flat equity markets, should we expect you to be below the guide on expenses given there's maybe more flexibility or kind of the range is the range and the revenue will be more kind of working independently?",neutral,0.0841,0.0898,0.8262
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Alex, that's a fair question, and you can see that part of the way we create some, I'll call it, insulation for ourselves as we think about equity markets and where they might go, whether it's up a lot, up modestly, flat or down is that we've designed our plans with the view that we should and intend to deliver a couple of points of operating leverage and actually a couple of points of fee operating leverage, right? That couple of points gives us some flexibility to handle some variability in what happens in actuality in equity markets. 
I think -- so certainly, we'll move within our range based on what we see. Obviously, if we see a market, an equity market correction of down 5% or down 10%, we'll do everything we can to come in below our range. And certainly, we can flex in this business, a full point can be flexed. It's not easy, but it can be flexed. And that would be the approach that we take. But we're confident with kind of the level of equity markets they are today, part of this -- part of what we see is a fairly nominal uptick in equity markets. So we think this is a good kind of middle of the fairway plan, but we'll certainly flex it, we -- to the extent that we can.",neutral,0.2898,0.0322,0.678
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,neutral,0.0315,0.0347,0.9338
49,James Francis Mitchell,,"Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the BBH. I appreciate the discussion around the increase in EBIT from rates. How much is that? Can you speak to their off-balance sheet sweep deposits, maybe update us on the level of that? And how you think those act at a rising rate environment in terms of the sweep fees? Is it pretty similar to the spread on deposits?",neutral,0.0729,0.0204,0.9067
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Jim, it's Eric. The business that Brown Brothers has run on the investment services side is performing well. So what we've seen is, with the higher equity markets, we've seen their servicing fees come in a bit stronger for this coming year. I think the deposits both on balance sheet and the swept ones are within the range of what we've seen. And I think we described those as a bit under $10 billion on balance sheet and a bit over $65 billion swept, and they're coming right around that range, and that's our expectation for 2022. 
The -- both the on and off balance sheet do have a good translation into higher revenues as rates move up. And the on balance sheet betas are similar to ours, and we had very nice betas in the early part of the last rate cycle and expect to have that again on ours and on theirs. And then the off-bound sweeps also have betas. They're not quite as strong as deposits, but they're in the range actually and that also will provide some very nice, I think, fee growth as we take on that business.",positive,0.7245,0.0196,0.2559
49,James Francis Mitchell,,"Okay. Great. And then maybe just pivoting to the asset management business. You had record flows, strongest flows in many years. Can you just describe where the biggest drivers of that growth are coming from? What you're doing to enhance that growth? And is this more just the environment's grade? Or do you think there's some sustainability to that debt inflow?",neutral,0.144,0.0214,0.8346
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Jim, it's Ron. Let me take that. I think that the growth is reasonably broad-based in the sense that it's firstly from our investments and ongoing investments in the ETF business. So you saw lots of strength in the core SPDR offerings, which are really instruments of choice for the -- for large institutional investors and good growth in areas where we have invested, active ETFs, fixed income, the low-cost ETFs, non-U.S. So we expect to continue to see a good performance there, particularly as we work to solidify our position with institutional investors. 
Secondly, in the institutional -- in the traditional institutional space, the team's done a lot of work in developing products that are companions to the core index business. We have a great client roster, and we've seen some diversification in that business. And finally, we've got a great cash business there. And obviously, it ebbs and flows as cash does itself, but we'll also benefit a little bit from rising rate environments as the remainder of the fee waivers goes away. So it's really across the board.",positive,0.8206,0.0107,0.1686
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,neutral,0.0373,0.0414,0.9214
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"So first, Eric, I just wanted to unpack some of the NII, the assumptions underpinning some of the NII guidance. I was hoping you can just share some insights in terms of what you're contemplating as the Fed initiates QT in terms of just deposit flight broadly or deposit runoff and maybe deposit remixing out of noninterest-bearing deposits. And just, in terms of spot rates, where you're reinvesting today versus the back book yield?",neutral,0.0662,0.0208,0.913
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure. Steve, it's Eric. Let me do that in reverse order. I think the front book and the back book are starting to converge in the investment portfolio, and you'll see that our investment portfolio yields took another small tick downward this quarter, in fourth quarter. But starting in first quarter, we'll see that relatively flat, and then you'll see a slow progression upwards. So we're comfortable with where we are in terms of long rates. And obviously, the higher the long rates come in, the better off we'll be. 
The NII uptick for this year, and then let me get to the question around balances and quantitative tightening, I think it's just comfortably dependent on the Fed increases. I think we're showing 10% to 12% expectations in NII, a little more than half of that is off of rising short-term U.S. rates, about a little less than 1/4 is off rising non-U.S. short-term rates and then the last portion is off of the rise in long rates. So we're really geared towards the front end rates and then that flows through directly to balances. 
For deposit balances, we currently expect U.S. and international deposit balances to be flattish, I'd say, this year. And I think we're all wrestling with what's the pace of the Fed's actions in terms of rising interest rates. When does that start? And then when do they start with the -- with some amount of quantitative tightening? And I think it's just helpful to book on this. 
There's been a lot of discussion about quantitative tightening for the last week or 2. Certainly, it will happen. If you go back to the last cycle, which was just 3, 4 years ago, so not a long time away, quantitative tightening started 2 years after the first rate rise and a full year after the second and third and fourth, kind of that steeper part of the rate rising cycle. And so I think quantitative tightening, there'll be a bid ask range on this, is something to expect in 2023 more than '22. And we'll thereby -- and then have some effect on deposits. 
How much, it's hard to tell. As you know, this cycle, we've controlled some of the uptick in deposits. We had pushed them off in third quarter, as you recall, let some back in this quarter. We'll certainly see some deposits ebb downwards in '23 and '24 perhaps or potentially just say flattish because the question is the pace of the quantitative tightening. And if you recall, last time around, just, I guess, 3, 4 years ago, I think the Fed felt like it tightened too much, right, and created some disruptions in the short-term money markets. And so -- but we expect some tightening to happen in, say, 1.5 years from now or thereabouts, we'll see. The -- I think the pace of the tightening may be more moderate. But anyway, we'll see. We'll see. That's, call it, a '23 topic. I think 2022 should be fairly straight.",neutral,0.1039,0.0689,0.8272
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"And just for a follow-up on how you're thinking about capital management. You spoke about reinitiating the buyback beginning in 2Q. I was hoping if you can give us some context as to like what level of payout you're planning as we look ahead to '22, '23? And just in terms of future changes to the capital regime, any guidance you can provide on the impact of SACCR or -- and preliminary thoughts on the impact of upcoming changes under a Basel IV regime would be really helpful.",neutral,0.1274,0.0124,0.8601
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure. There's a lot there, Steve, in your question. So let me take it kind of from the near-end time frame to further out. We've -- I think we're pretty comfortable with our capital guidance that we'll be at the low end of our 10% to 11% range for CET1 in the first quarter. That includes both the SACCR being implemented and the confirmation of the Brown Brothers acquisition. So that, I think, will carry us through at the low end of our range for the first half of this year. And we're, I think, comfortable with both of those. 
As we go through the year, in the second quarter, we'd certainly like to start the buyback. We'll see at what pace. The pace of a buyback start will depend on the kind of the exact capital ratios as we hit first quarter. And then second quarter, we'll see how OCI swings, either positively or negatively. And so I think that then sets us up to start buying back stock in the second quarter and then proceeding at pace in the third quarter, fourth quarter and beyond. 
And then, I think, at that point, we're back to trying to -- we're not trying, but operating within our guidance that capital return should be in the 80% plus of earnings. And that puts us, I think, in a way that we continue to return through dividends and buybacks capital in a nice comfortable way. 
So anyway, a nice path forward. But first half of this year, I think low end of our ranges. And then in the second quarter and then third quarter, fourth quarter, we start to reinstate and then accelerate in buybacks to a comfortable level. 
The Basel III refinements, Basel IV end game, there are different ways [ to inflow ] capital out there. It will certainly come to pass. Clearly, we'll get some benefits on the loan book, though we have a smaller loan book than others. So we'll probably get some headwinds from the fundamental review of the trading book and then some headwinds from the ops risk capital charges. So my guess is it will be a bit of a headwind. But, like I said before, it's been all factored into our capital ratio guidance. We generate quite a bit of capital each year. And we feel comfortable that we can continue to deliver on our medium-term targets of returning 80% or more of earnings back to shareholders.",neutral,0.2369,0.0252,0.7378
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"That's great color, Eric. And just quickly, can you -- did you quantify the impact from SACCR, just so we could start to reflect that in our models?",neutral,0.1396,0.0109,0.8495
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I didn't in the prepared remarks. But the rough amount, we carry typically about $115 billion of RWAs. It was a little less this quarter. SACCR is -- will cost us in the first quarter just over $10 billion. And we've got offsetting actions worth about half of that, about half, so call it around $5 billion. So I think net basis, it's probably worth about $5 of RWA. But as I said before in my prepared remarks, this has all been factored into our capital guidance that we gave back over the last several quarters, and we're confirming and affirming that will be within our ranges in the first half of the year.",neutral,0.0902,0.0248,0.8849
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,neutral,0.0347,0.0412,0.9242
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Eric, can you give us some further color on -- you gave us good detail on the servicing fee growth and how you expect to see that 3% to 4% grow this year with some new inflows, as you pointed out, but also from some equity improvement in the markets, I think you said about 2 percentage points of that number. When you take the -- when you look at the equity portion, how important is the U.S. markets versus EMEA and the other markets? Can you kind of give us a flavor? Is it generally geared toward the U.S. markets that drives your growth?",neutral,0.1654,0.0117,0.8228
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Gerard, it's Eric. It's really a mix. I think maybe almost, if I just think about the ranges, it's a bit under half that's driven by U.S. markets, closer to probably, I don't know, 1/3-ish of European markets. And then Australia and emerging markets, just because of the, in some cases, the higher fee rates, is also important. That could be worth 20%, 25%. 
The other is, remember, we have -- part of our book is fixed income assets that we service. And so that's why equity market tailwinds affect part of our book, but not all of our book, in rising rates, we've got the opposite effect in -- on the fixed income side. 
What I -- just as we -- from planning purposes, as we go into the year, though, on a point-to-point basis or if we were to stay flat from now through the end of the year versus the average of last year of 2021, that in and of itself should give us at least 1 point, 1.5 points of servicing fee lift. And then what we're talking about is whether the point-to-point growth from December 31 to 2022 December 31, can give us that extra 0.5 point. 
So I think that's how you get the roughly 2 percentage point tailwind that we expect. Some of it is, in a way, baked in, assuming markets don't go down and then a smaller piece is coming from some modest depreciation.",neutral,0.115,0.0484,0.8366
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, you discussed it as have your peers about the expectation of rising interest rates -- short-term rates, the run rates in 2022. Can you share with us the duration of the fixed income portfolio? And what rates should we watch carefully that would impact the AOCI, meaning the mark-to-market would be negative for the portfolio?",neutral,0.037,0.2826,0.6804
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. We -- the duration of the investment portfolio, we inched down this quarter. You could have seen that in the NII slide that we had. I think we're at about 2.9 years, so trended down a bit from the last quarter -- last couple of quarters. And right now, we're a little more comfortable. We've been investing in the belly of the curve, kind of the 2- to 5-year range. 
I think the 10-year up through 2 percentage points is quite comfortable for us, including from an OCI management standpoint. I think if you get a good bit above 2 percentage points on the 10-year, you kind of have -- you got a double effect. On one hand, you get an OCI hit, which obviously accretes back over time, so it's temporary. And on the other hand, you celebrate higher rates flowing through the investment portfolios over the coming quarters. So I think it's mix, but net positive if we have some sort of spike at the back end. But it would affect just the mechanics of how we operate quarter-to-quarter on the margin.",neutral,0.146,0.3362,0.5178
0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.,neutral,0.0328,0.0355,0.9316
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,You had another good quarter of loan growth here with average loans up 7.5% sequentially. What were the drivers there? And how sustainable do you think that is into 2022?,neutral,0.4899,0.017,0.4932
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Rob, it's Eric. Loan growth has been good for us the last, say, couple of years, to be honest. I think we've comfortably driven loan growth quarter after quarter up in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis. 
This quarter, we continue to see good client demand, but we also shifted some -- we also added some CLOs in loan form as we reduced the CLOs in securities form from the investment portfolio. So there was a bit of a shift. That said, I think, in general, what we're comfortable doing is continue to grow core loans because that's -- we won't always have a shift every quarter. This is more episodic, just as we rebalance and think about stress testing and how to operate efficiently with our multiple constraints. But we're still comfortable continuing to grow this loan portfolio in the low double-digit range. It won't happen every quarter. There's a little bit of seasonality, but we continue to see quite strong demand from our alternative clients and private equity capital call financing. We see demand in some [arts] of the alternative and real estate markets that we play in. 
And the biggest focus, I'd say, is, as we lend more and deploy capital to our clients, a lot of what we do is work with them and make sure that's part of a broader relationship because that's where it really is remunerative for us and for them and helps us grow the -- helps us build the reputation and the momentum to build the fee line as well.",positive,0.5759,0.0161,0.408
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"Got it. And then turning to expenses and operating leverage. The outlook implies maybe a 2 percentage point delta between fee growth and expense growth, but that also bakes in plus 5% or 6% from investments in variable costs. Do you think of that as still an elevated level of investment and there's some more operating leverage available longer term? Or is this kind of the required level of investment going forward?",neutral,0.1413,0.0222,0.8365
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"It's hard to forecast the future. The amount of investments is partly around what's table stakes in the marketplace and partly around where do we see opportunities to differentiate our offerings? And clearly, you've seen us invest in particular, in Alpha, in the front office, and Alpha that spans into the middle and back office. And we're also finding opportunities in the back office to invest through sort of feature functionality enhancements and custody in some areas of accounting, which also is attractive segment by segment. 
So it's hard for me to say what's the necessary amount of investments. We think there's a range. We think, last year, we probably invested a bit less than this, probably instead of 5% to 6%, I'd say there was probably 1.5 points less of investments during 2021. So I think what you'll see is, you'll see us flex the amount of investments from one year to the next. 
I think what we're conscious of is that confidence in investing should come from seeing the revenue growth and seeing the revenue growth from past investments. And that's what we're seeing. We're seeing the revenue growth on the past investments that we've made across the franchise, and I think that gives us the confidence to continue to carefully invest, and, in some cases, accelerate that, but I think in modest ways. 
I think the other part of our culture has been to, at the same time as we invest, find productivity and savings. And that's -- we think that's an important part of how to run a business, but certainly a business that over time we're digitizing and automating should come with productivity savings and engineering. And I think the other part of our business processes, and I think you'd hear this from our senior executives, the more we can drive in productivity saves, the more we feel comfortable in investing and that's a very -- that's a virtuous circle.",neutral,0.1119,0.0195,0.8686

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"What I would just add to that is that it's actually good news that we're seeing opportunities to invest in the business because -- particularly as we've built out the Alpha platform, which was originally aimed at the asset management space and the traditional asset managers, we're now starting to roll out Alpha for private markets. So it's good that we're seeing the opportunities, but I would underscore Eric's point that notwithstanding that goodness, what we're focused on is continuing to eke out higher and higher productivity. And we see more opportunities there. So we see the ability of this virtuous cycle to continue for quite a while longer. And the fact that there are investment opportunities is actually a good thing because it shows that notwithstanding the narrowness of our -- of where we operate, there's plenty of spaces to grow.",positive,0.8023,0.0095,0.1882

11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Question on the deferred comp acceleration, I'm just curious, what level employee are we talking? And I'm asking because the deferred portion, obviously, you're saying to get practices more competitive, so that presumes that you were deferring more than peers and that, going forward, you'd have a higher cash piece going forward.

45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"And then, Glenn, just to give you context. The -- we've made this change. We had made one change 5 years back. And I think this now gets us to be competitive with the marketplace. And the way -- the facts that might help a little bit is, way back when we had immediate cash in the 30% range of compensation for the average employee, the deferred cash was 40% and the equity, the deferred equity was 30%. That was a place that was completely out of market. 
We fixed about 2/3 of that 5 years ago and got to 50% immediate cash, 20% deferred cash and 30% deferred equity. And now we're -- with this final change, we're going to take that up to the immediate cash to 60% to 65%, the deferred cash to just 5% to 10%, mostly for the most senior folks, and then the deferred equity stays at 30%. So we think we're now in line with the market as part of this change. 
What does happen is you've got to crystallize some of the -- some of these deferrals into the P&L in the current period. And then what that allows us to do is, going forward, to add to the cash mix. And because we've crystallized the previous deferrals, those don't hit the P&L in the future, but the new cash will hit the P&L in the future.

And if you think about culture, which is a very used and sometimes maligned term, for us, it's about desired behaviors, and, on the flip side, kind of eliminating undesirable behaviors. 
So what we're focused on is those desirable behaviors, all related to kind of driving performance. I would argue that it's even more important now than when we started a couple of years ago because on top of everything else that we need in terms of serving our clients and serving our shareholders, we're now operating -- we're now all operating in this hybrid world for the foreseeable future. That puts a burden, new burdens and new requirements on managers, particularly middle managers. So it's all about being able to eke out the benefits, which are considerable in a hybrid world in terms of employee flexibility and some real estate cost savings and those kinds of things, but at the same time, making sure that we're continuing to deliver where we are.

6,Brennan Hawken,,"I wanted to circle back, Eric. I believe I just wanted to kind of clarify some of the points you made. I think you talked about BBH and the EBIT growth expected to accelerate here in 2022 up to 25%. So just to make sure I'm level-setting correctly, you also talked about some strength in servicing, if not all, NII. That 25%, should we apply that to the $375 million that you provided previously when you announced the deal? Or did that actual number shift from expectation? And am I using the right baseline? And then for the other disclosures you provided around the revenue and whatnot, should we -- did those shake out in line with expectations? Or did they work out to be a little better as you alluded to? And how should we think about that baseline when we think about 3 quarters of a year here for them?",neutral,0.1329,0.0294,0.8377
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Let me -- fair questions, Brennan, it's Eric. We had, as you remember, accurately estimated their 2021 performance to be EBIT of about $375 million, and they came in right around that level. So we're comfortable with that as a base case. And if you recall, we had shown 17% growth from 2020 to '21 in our -- in some of our documentation as we announced the Brown Brothers Investment Services acquisition. 
From a deal model perspective, at the time, we had expected off of the '21 base to grow at about 15%. So in line with the past, part of that was the equity market tailwinds continued to play through, and part of that was just good business performance. The -- our Brown Brothers colleagues and investment services really drive a nice set of initiatives each year to drive growth, client activity and so forth. 
And what we're finding now is because of the equity market step off and the interest rate environment, we expect to be roughly at about a 25% EBIT growth from '21 to '22. I think a portion of that is on the equity -- is on the servicing fee line. A portion of that is on the fee line that comes from the sweeps. Remember that comes through the fees as well. And then a portion is from on-balance sheet NII. And I don't have the pieces handy, but clearly, the interest rate tailwind is probably the more significant of those factors, and that will affect both the on balance sheet and the swept deposits.",neutral,0.1423,0.0367,0.8209
6,Brennan Hawken,,Okay. Great. And then separate issue for my second question. It looks like there's a transitional leadership. It seems like Cyrus is retiring in the asset management business. That's been a business where there's been both speculation and open discussion with you all in the past about strategic direction and whatnot. What does the transition in leadership present as far as an opportunity to shift strategic direction? And what can you let us know about your updated thoughts on that business and whether or not a leadership transition is impacting the direction you want to go?,neutral,0.044,0.0259,0.93
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Brennan, I mean as you can maybe see from our results, we've invested in that business over the years and the investments are paying off. We like the business. It's very complementary to the core servicing business. Having one of the largest asset managers also as our client of our core business has been able to let us have a bit of an R&D laboratory. There's client overlap in certain segments like asset owners and sovereign wealth funds that we've gotten better and better at leveraging. So we like the business. We intend to stay in the business. 
Under Cyrus leadership, they've done a great job, and the numbers speak for themselves there. So I wouldn't expect to see a broad strategic change here, certainly not in the direction I just outlined. I mean, there's always opportunities to do more and do better in all of our businesses. So we'll want to continue to do that. 
We've got a very strong talent base there, but this is an attractive business, and one in which we will look inside and out and get the right person to take us to the next level here. But we have full intention of continuing to run and grow that business.",positive,0.5768,0.0105,0.4127

25,Michael C. Brown,,"So I appreciate the update on BBH and the EBIT outlook there. And I guess, as we move closer to that closing date, I was just curious, the change in the EBIT outlook and the operating environment, does that actually trigger any increase in the total consideration that will need to be paid? Obviously, the implied valuation would be lower than at announcement, that was just one thought that crossed my mind. 
And then the follow-up there is, can you just remind us of the unexpected fee synergies specifically, which ones do you feel confident that you can deliver on sooner after the close versus the one that will take more time to come through?",neutral,0.1333,0.0471,0.8196
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Mike, why don't I start that, and I'll turn the synergy part of the question over to Eric. But no, there's no contingencies in the purchase price either up or down other than the usual ones that you would expect in terms of risk management. So no, there's no additional payment that will be due here.",neutral,0.0468,0.059,0.8942
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"And Mike, it's Eric. Just on the synergies. I think each one of them has a cadence, some of which we did spell out, I think, on the cost synergies, which is the opportunity. And that's obviously -- sometimes will come out of their base of expenses, sometimes our base of expenses as we put the 2 together. We had estimated about 40% of our cost synergies would come in year 1 and then the balance year 2 and 3. And that's probably the single largest area. 
In terms of the fee synergies, the balance sheet actions should come through relatively quickly. We can modulate the amount of swept versus on-balance sheet deposits because we've got the capital resources planned for that. And I think that's one of the ways that we create real value. 
And then the last one on the fee revenue synergies. Some of the FX kind of markets, synergies come in a little more quickly, right? Because it's about offering a broader set of, say, FX products, some of which were more capital-intensive than simple swaps forwards. That is more about setting up clients and then quickly being there for them. And then some of the servicing ones take a little longer in part of the sales cycle. But I think there's a good mix. And obviously, as we work on closing and bringing Brown Brothers in, part of what we've been doing is, as you expect, kicking the tires on what are the opportunities, how to go to the next round of definition on those so that we can hit the ground running. And as I've said, when we announced the deal, we'd like to meet or exceed our targets. And I think the exogenous market tailwinds are part of that, but we'd also like to do it on -- through old fashion execution as well.",neutral,0.092,0.019,0.889
25,Michael C. Brown,,"Okay. Great. I appreciate the color there. And maybe just one last one, just a quick clarification. Apologies if I missed, but did you quantify that discrete tax benefit? Or is the best way to think about that is just back into it after considering your typical tax rate?",neutral,0.0425,0.0384,0.919
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"It's -- I wrestled, Mike, with that because there were actually a series of tax benefits that came through this quarter. There was some closing of the previous year tax books. There were some foreign credits that accrue in those jurisdictions, which then help our GAAP taxes and then there are some foreign credits, but then kind of map back into the U.S. as a tax payments of the deduction. So there's a series of them. I think the best way to do it is to probably take -- our full year tax rates are typically in the 17% to 19% range. So you take the midpoint of that, think about full year this year now with these discrete, which were more elevated than usual in a good way, got us to closer to 15% tax rate. 
And I think the difference is probably the -- you might call the lumpy piece. What I do -- what I would, though, also note is that, I think tax planning has been the kind of thing that we've done for many years. We do it -- we're always on the bright side of the line, and we do it carefully. We -- part of it being an international bank, we like other international banks, are able to do some -- a modest amount of tax planning. And so you'll see it -- I think it's -- we see that come through the P&L annually, it just tends to be a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and it was a little more lumpy good than usual this particular quarter.",neutral,0.0826,0.0395,0.8779

0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0374,0.0419,0.9207
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Great. Maybe just circle back on the deposit opportunity for BBH. Just to clarify, I think you said there's right now $10 billion of deposits out on the balance sheet at BBH and then $55 billion additional in the sweep program. And I think, initially, you were planning to bring about a total of $20 billion inclusive of the deposits on the balance sheet over to State Street to convert. Initially, I think, $14 billion was the conversion to get you to $20 billion. Maybe if you could just update us on the plan for 2022, if you do close at quarter end in the first quarter, of what you'd like to bring on? And then maybe just talk more strategically about maybe what kind of portion of that sweep opportunity you might bring on to -- on the balance sheet, I guess, capital permitting?",neutral,0.0655,0.0174,0.9171
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure, Brian, it's Eric. I think you have a good estimate of those. Just for the broader group, I think we said about $5 billion to $10 billion are on the balance sheet today, about $65 billion are off balance sheet and swapped. As we consummate the acquisition and we're targeting the first quarter, we said at the end of the first quarter, we're targeting. We said it could be in the second quarter, so this stuff just takes time. We're looking to bring on the $5 billion to $ 10 billion that they have on the balance sheet and probably another $10-ish billion or so that is swept. 
I think over time, the question is really, at what interest rate levels do we operate at? If we're at prevailing short rates of 50 basis points, let's say, then on balance sheet deposits aren't terribly attractive. But when you hit prevailing short rates of 100 bps or 200 bps, and obviously, you can do this across different currencies, then you're more inclined to bring more on balance sheet. And so we think of it as a range. I think, we also, though, are quite -- we want to be quite thoughtful about maintaining a program that works well, that works well for our clients and the Brown Brothers Investment Services' clients, it works well for a number of global financial institutions that they have relationships with that they sweep primarily dollar deposits to who appreciate those deposits. 
And so we certainly want to maintain the program for sweeps, we want to maintain it in size. But you can certainly see swings of another $10 billion beyond the initial move potentially. But we're -- I think we'll see when we get there, and part of it will be discussions with the clients themselves on one hand and part of it will be with the counterparties. And I think there'll be goodness and opportunity here in most circumstances.",neutral,0.1217,0.0174,0.8609
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"That's great color. And maybe just a segue to second question on deposit beta expectations. I think you mentioned you thought they might be similar to the last hiking cycle. Just to confirm that, it seemed like they moved around a bit during the cycle, but kind of ended up around -- it looks like a little over 30% of a deposit beta relative to Fed funds rates at the time. I don't know maybe if you can clarify that, and if you think that would be similar to this cycle? And then, obviously, if you would be treating those BBH deposits in a similar fashion? Or do they have a different profile?",neutral,0.0532,0.0357,0.911
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure, Brian. And it was actually a good opportunity as we see rates rise and the likelihood of the Fed funds. We did get a chance to go back and revisit what we both said and what we saw in -- from a deposit beta standpoint, back in 2015, 2016, 2017. I do expect the Brown Brothers deposits behave similarly to ours. They are primarily with asset managers. They are currency by currency, similar to ours. But if you go back, and I think we were good about disclosing our quarter-on-quarter interest-bearing deposit betas and usually, you have to do it by currency, right, so -- because of how the betas play through. 
But in the first rate, the first 1 or 2 rate hikes, we saw and expect again to see deposit betas in, call it, 10% range, maybe 10% to 15% range, but it's quite low. When you get to the third, fourth or fifth hike, you're in the 30% range, plus or minus some as you leg into the rate cycle. And it's really when you get in the -- past there in the fifth, sixth, seventh hike, where you're likely to get closer to 50% interest-bearing deposit betas. 
Now I'd like to get there. We'd be pleased with 50% if we get there with that level of prevailing rates. But there's -- I think there's a good opportunity here because, in truth, we've been quite limited in our ability to earn NII that covers our cost of capital. And so a lot of this is just catch up to a level that are more in line with the long-term averages.",neutral,0.1801,0.0535,0.7664
