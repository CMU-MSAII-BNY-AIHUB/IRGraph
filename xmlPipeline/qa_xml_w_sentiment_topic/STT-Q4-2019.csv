0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0427,0.0271,0.9301
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Eric, you just ran through a bunch of color on expectations for the year in 1Q. One that I was hoping to dig a little in on is the fee revenue side. I think you said that the 1Q fee revenue growth down 2% to 3% sequentially, and you gave a couple of factors. Does that guidance include what we've seen so far year-to-date in the equity markets, which has been pretty robust? Or is that a potential offset if it proves to be durable through the quarter?",negative,0.1312,0.7582,0.1106
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brennan, it's Eric. The guidance is effectively as a combination at the end of the year. And obviously, if there's large dislocations between then and now, we factor it in. I think you'd say equity markets are up. Volatility still, though, on -- and trading is still pretty light. We've not seen that big January uptick that I think we used to see 4, 5 years ago. Interest rates have been, call it, puttering around. So I don't think there's a lot that's really changed, and this is an outlook effectively based on what we see now. 
I think that I described, there's -- some of this is just the usual seasonality like in Charles River, which peaks in fourth quarter just because of the cycle of sales that's come through and then dip in first quarter. We have some visibility into servicing fees. Asset management fees, I noted will take a bit of a step down. Trading, we'll see. So it's kind of a combination that we're looking at.",neutral,0.1325,0.0889,0.7786
6,Brennan Hawken,,"That's all really fair. And then when we think about some of these robust equity markets that we've seen, and you guys have clearly done a really good job of trying to get your hands around the elevated fee pressure that you were seeing over early 2019 and leading into that. 
In the past, we've seen some breakage in fee rate when equity markets rally really hard really fast because your servicing fees are not all just purely contractually a percentage of AUC's basis points on assets under custody. Some of them are inflation. Some of them were pegged activity levels and the like. 
So can you help us think about -- should we be prepared for optically the way we model State Street some fee rate pressure here in the near term just because of those mechanical factors rather than thinking -- I just -- I know some people think that when the equity markets go up, okay, then the servicing fee is going to go up with the fee rate being flat. In the past, it hasn't worked out that way. So just trying to think about how to calibrate for that.",neutral,0.1197,0.0612,0.819
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Brennan, it's Ron. Let me begin on that. I mean in the past, you're correct, there has been a cycle when you've seen sharp-up equity markets that has been followed by a relook by the client base at what they're paying, and a wave of fee renegotiation. And that's still possible. I think what's different this time is, firstly, we have comprehensively been through the client base, either at their bidding or at our bidding. In some instances, we've been the proactive ones wanting to take control of the situation. We've tended to get more term out of these things. And in general, the level of partnership that's between us and our clients now is at a much higher level. 
So I would suspect -- my expectation would be that certainly, there'll be some conversation, but I would not expect the same kind of effect that we've seen in the past. Eric, you may want to add something to that.",neutral,0.1291,0.0343,0.8367
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Brennan, I'd just add the kind of quantitative side to this is, remember, most of our fee schedules in the servicing business are based off of averages, average for a quarter or multiple months within a quarter or what have you. And so it's worth just remembering that if you take through the appreciation in stock market indices, and I think there is a good table on the top right of Page 6 in our slide deck, the S&P -- and this is 4Q to 4Q. But if you think about it on a full year basis, which I think a number of you have, the S&P was up 29% end-of-period to end-of-period, that feels great. But the average was up only 6%, right? The EAFE average point-to-point was up 18%. On average, it was actually down 4%. So it's really the averages that are factoring through. And I just encourage you to think about those as you think about modeling the servicing fee effects. And in addition, those are what the -- but what we focus on, both from a -- as we think about the calculation of the servicing fees, but also what the clients think about as part of the building process.",neutral,0.2147,0.0798,0.7054
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,neutral,0.0406,0.0483,0.9111
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Curious if you could talk -- and you might have touched on it a little bit, but if you could talk on your deposit optimization efforts, what's working and where you are through the process you've been going through client by client. 4% growth is good. Do you consider any of it repo environment related and transient? Just curious to get the mark-to-market on that.",neutral,0.1296,0.0133,0.8571
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure, Glenn. It's Eric. Let me start. Deposit initiatives were something that we really began to focus on late in fourth quarter of '18, I think I'd say, and then it's been an intense effort for 4 or 5 quarters now. And it really is in response to thinking about how do we serve our clients with our balance sheet. Now as you say, sometimes it's deposits, sometimes it's cash money market sweeps into the asset manager. Sometimes it's some of the sponsored repo that we do. So there's a series of different areas. 
I don't think it's particularly -- the results of those initiatives on a year-on-year basis are north of $10 billion of deposits, tend to be more on the interest-bearing side because that's what's discretionary. It's come in probably 3 buckets. The largest of the buckets is working with our custody clients and thinking about how to serve them on their discretionary cash. Sometimes it's the asset managers. Sometimes it's insurers. Sometimes it's the pension funds. So that's been -- that's probably been the biggest piece. 
We've also, I think, built up over time a book of corporate deposits. Because remember, not only do we have partners and suppliers for corporations, but because of our custody of the pension plans, right, we have often an introduction from the pension -- the defined benefit pension plans or 401(k) plan into the corporate treasurer. And so that creates a natural access. 
And then the third bucket is we always supplement with a little bit of CDs or broker deposits, but I think that's been probably the smallest of this of the three buckets. 
So those are the kind of initiatives we've taken. They've been, I think, material in terms of continuing to build our balance sheet, which then lets us -- provides enough oxygen, in effect, for us to build our loan book, our investment portfolio, our trading book. And so that's kind of part of how we think about running the bank. 
And then specific to your question of would it have been better, different, lower, higher because of quantitative easing or not, I don't think the initiatives would have been particularly different. I do think there is more deposits in the system, in the banking system, and we've seen some of that probably starting in the second half of the third quarter in that kind of period when the Fed began to intervene and into fourth quarter. It's hard to dimension how much there is, but you and I both read the Fed H.8 reports, and that kind of gives you a little bit of an indication.",neutral,0.0552,0.0347,0.9101
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"I appreciate that. And maybe one more on just the servicing wins. $294 billion in the quarter, $1.8 trillion for the year. If you look at that, that's over 5% organic growth. Now obviously, it's a gross number, not net. I don't know if you want to share just a ballpark range of where net is. But then the specific question is if you can help us with the composition of what's in the won but not yet funded pipe. I see some of the press releases. I see some ETF wins in there in the fourth quarter, but maybe just help us think through what's in there.",neutral,0.0756,0.0206,0.9038
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes, Glenn. It's Ron. It's a mix of things that are in there. It's -- some of it is true one-offs, meaning we've won something. It's in the queue to be installed. It'll be installed. More typically, just given the nature of our client base, which tends to be larger asset managers and asset owners, when we win something, we install in tranches. Sometimes it could be very conventional business, like we have a very large mutual fund win earlier in the year. But some of the funds are more complicated than others. Sometimes the client wants it done in a particular sequence around their fund boards. So there's some of that in there. You can probably draw the conclusion that the more complicated of business tends to get involved later. 
The other thing that's in there, though, is, increasingly, the nature of our business is that we're not just winning a custody or accounting assignment, but we're winning all or a portion of the front-to-back, meaning there's some middle office in there, there might be some Charles River in there. So oftentimes, what you're seeing is a installation of another service for an existing client where we had an install earlier in the year. And that's the way to think about it.",neutral,0.0409,0.0615,0.8976
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Got it. Okay. That's interesting. I appreciate it. And is it in and around the range of the average margin? Because I know going piece by piece would be impossible. But just like the ones that not yet funded, is it coming in at a higher level, average level or below average level?",neutral,0.0646,0.0401,0.8952
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Glenn, it's Eric. It's -- I think, as Ron said, it's a mix. It's -- well, it's a mix of fee rate and it's a mix of timing. And as you could see, the to be installed was high a quarter ago. It's high again this quarter. And so sometimes this installs more quickly. Sometimes more slowly. So just -- I know it's hard to model. I just encourage you to put a big band around it.",neutral,0.0524,0.0515,0.896
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,neutral,0.0418,0.0289,0.9294
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"To follow-up on the NII outlook, Eric. I was wondering when you talk about the expected decline next year, can you just give us a little bit more color on just the dynamics of how much and how the lower rates from last year still roll through on the NIM? And also against your point about there being some excess deposits in the system, but you're still growing these deposits from your strategic initiatives, can the balance sheet also expand to continue to expand from here? So I guess just a split dynamic of what happens on the NIM side versus what happens on the balance sheet.",neutral,0.1546,0.339,0.5064
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Ken. It's Eric. You're right that -- you're asking the volume question and the rate question. So maybe -- let me do that in that order. 
I think from a volume perspective, the 2 drivers that we see in this business are, firstly, the amount of wins that we have in custody and accounting because those typically come with those residual deposits that -- the frictional deposit in the system. And so those will come based on the kind of the win rates that we have and some of the installation. 
I think the other one is the deposits in the system. And I think we've clearly seen a bit of an uptick quarter-over-quarter based on the bank-wide data as well as some of the -- some of what you've seen in our results and a couple of the other banks that you've all seen that in the Fed statistics. 
I think the question is, what happens to deposits in the banking system over the next year? Did we just -- did the Fed in effect with its easing process over the last 4, 5, 6 months get us to a new level and then we just go back to the slow build off of that? Or is there going to be more or less Fed activity? And I'll leave that one to -- for you to think about. I think that one is the uncertainty. 
So we do expect some amount of modest deposit growth. I think the -- what we're careful on, on deposits and we still expect to see is some amount of continued rotation from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing or interest-bearing into treasuries because you're seeing that in the underlying asset holdings of our clients in the industry. And as we think about the volume of deposits going forward, we've been comforted that there have been 3 quarters in a row of stable noninterest-bearing deposits. But I'll remind you, third quarter and fourth quarter of '18 actually saw an uptick in noninterest-bearing deposits, and then it fell by -- it fell significantly in the first quarter of '19 from 4Q '18. So we're hesitant to think that we're -- we've gotten to a sea change. We like to see a flattening of that line, but we're hesitant to call that a sea change just yet, which is why we do think there will be some continued rotation in the coming quarters and year. 
I think from a rate standpoint, it's everything you'd expect as long rates still have a negative effect on a full year basis again. So long rates, I guess I should say, long rates have a negative effect as the tractor of the investment portfolio plays through. And unless long rates pop up 30, 40, 50 bps, you still have that playing through to a negative. You have the short rates are -- kind of have been reset, and so we're going to -- it's going to take 3 or 4 quarters to lap ourselves, and so you have that effect playing through. 
And then you have some -- as we think about the first quarter, as an example, you've got some transactional impacts, right, as we call those perhaps, we replace them with long-term debt, right, because we have TLAC requirements. And so in effect, I end up with a higher net income, but the -- I get it -- we get higher available to common, but we also have a -- also have more interest expense because of how the P&L accounting is for us. 
So anyway, I'm hoping I covered most of it there.",negative,0.0906,0.5708,0.3386
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Yes. And just one more, just balance sheet structure question to your point on the preferreds. You did that redemption. You said you were -- last quarter, you're able to do that before getting even the final. Could you continue to do more in that ahead of getting the finalization of SCB? Or does now SCB finalization really lead any further decisions you make about the balance sheet structure and capital actions?",neutral,0.0758,0.0176,0.9066
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Ken, fair question. But obviously, we're -- any kind of decision by us around CCAR about interim capital actions is something that we just don't have an ability to telegraph beforehand or to really discuss. I'd just tell you, we always look at the full range of what we can do. We're always conscious that there are periods immediately after CCAR where one tends to have an opportunity. It gets a little more delicate in the first quarter. So let me just leave it at that. 
It's the kind of thing where I don't think timing matters a ton about when we take our capital actions, but the -- but we are looking at, obviously, the change in the leverage rules. And then importantly, we need to see how the SCB comes through. And that's -- that I think we'll know in the coming weeks, and then we'll start to gear up for the -- for these -- for our annual CCAR process.",neutral,0.0426,0.0571,0.9003
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0399,0.0336,0.9265
4,Alexander Blostein,,"I was hoping to dig into NIR in the quarter around some of the deposit cost trends. If I look at the non-U.S. side, it looks like it was a negative 4 bps kind of number. I know there's some FX dynamics that are all through that, that could create a little bit of noise. But can you help us understand just kind of where you guys are in terms of deposit costs, how you expect it to evolve from here? And if there's anything one-off this quarter that helped that?",neutral,0.073,0.2482,0.6788
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Alex. It's Eric. I think there are a couple of probably elements here that are going through the deposit costs on the U.S. side and then the non-U.S. side. And the page for those of you on the phone probably best to look through is the financial addendum that we have, Page 7. There's a detailed sort of average balance sheet table over the last 8 quarters for everyone. 
On the U.S. side, you see our deposit costs came down, I think, a nice 19 basis points. Most of that is on the U.S. fee side. Obviously, this is a domicile view, not the currency view, but it's indicative. And that's really the effect of that October rate cut and the full quarter effect of that coming through, adjusted for our mix of pricing and so forth. And so I think you see the right sort of betas in that kind of 50% range that we've been seeing flowing through that line. 
The non-U.S. domicile is a little messier. Part of what you see there -- and that one fell that those interest -- that interest expense fell more than you would naturally expect. It actually went from a positive interest expense to a credit in effect. Part of that was, remember, the ECB move, and we moved as well. We actually -- our beta was over [ 100% ] on that ECB move just as we had this begin to normalize NIM in the international markets as other banks are doing as well, given that it seems like it's going to be negative, not for a temporary period, but for the foreseeable future. And so we're beginning to -- I think the banking industry is beginning to reset what kind of NIM should be earned on deposits because of that change. And then we also have less in the FX swap costs. And so we had less swap expense, which then goes through that line of the P&L and that we have in the footnotes, and that just bounced around a bit with the costs being on the interest-earning asset side.",negative,0.0869,0.4744,0.4387
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. That's helpful. And then a slightly bigger picture question to you guys on profitability. I guess when we take a step back, obviously, a very nice move on expenses this year, and you guys have more to do next year. I guess when you go back a year or so ago, you had a slide out talking about medium-term pretax targets kind of shooting for 2 percentage point improvement in pretax margin. That's still the case, but I'm curious what's the base and what total may be the destination here because in 2018, pretax margins were 28, 29. You guys are kind of 26-ish this year. So I guess off of which base should we be thinking about the 2 percentage point improvement?",neutral,0.1149,0.0453,0.8398
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Alex, it's Eric. Let me start on that because I think it's something that we've obviously been thinking through the markets. When we set those up with the markets at a certain point, they worked against us, both on the equity market side, which has largely bounced back. Now we need to kind of -- it's going to take a few more quarters to get to a place where we're pleased, and that was in our outlook. But it was also at a time when NII, right, was expected to go up, and NII has actually gone the other way. And I think I mentioned in one of the conferences late last year that, that change in NII cost us effectively 2 points of margin. 
That said, that's just information. I think when we think about how we need to run this business, we still need to drive towards those targets and drive to those targets at pace. And I think we've been clear that at the time we set those, the pretax margin was in the 28% range. And I tell you, we're at 26% now. We need to -- we've got plans to get to 27%, 28% and 29% and ultimately get that three handle or the 30% handle on margin because we think this is a business that should operate at that level. And I think if you work through some of our guidance for this year, you see us making headway on margin, driving revenues up and expenses down. And I think you'd continue to expect that kind of leverage. Operating leverage and margin expansion is kind of tantamount and kind of a fundamental part of our planning process. So we're standing by those targets. We think they're important, and they were well set and those are -- that's where we're headed.",neutral,0.2652,0.076,0.6588
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0399,0.0359,0.9242
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Can you just come back to the pricing pressure concept in asset servicing? And one detail I did miss, if you could just clarify, the fees down 2% to 3% in 1Q, just the servicing -- asset servicing fee component of that for 1Q. But the broader question is, we've had that 4% pricing pressure, I think, that you identified, Eric, a while back, and that had been moderating to that sort of 2% headwind. Just want to get your thought about that headwind coming into 2020 and clarify that, that's -- that is separate from a mix shift. And when I talk about that as a -- the common mix shift towards ETF and away from mutual funds, which I know are lower revenue capture, albeit they are just as -- I believe, they're just as profitable because of the lower cost that's servicing them. So maybe if you could just talk about that dynamic in the -- as how that shapes that 2020 1% to 2% up for servicing fees.",neutral,0.0848,0.1932,0.722
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Why don't I begin this, Brian? Because there's a lot in what you asked in terms of pricing and how we think about our outlook on pricing and pricing pressure. I mean if you look back on this business for time immemorial, right, there's been -- there's kind of enduring deflation in the business, which we've all come to know and live with, and that's been a result of a combination of business growing, ability to scale, et cetera. And that's been historically a 2%. 
There's also been mix shift that's been underway since then, too. I mean the mutual fund ETF move is not new. It certainly accelerated over the last few years. So -- and we expect that mix shift to continue. 
I mean the other factor in here is there's increasing concentration amongst ETF providers. We have a very large market share amongst ETF providers. But obviously, as those providers get larger, the nature of the fee rate typically is such that they're paying up less than the marginal asset. 
So -- but this is the nature of the business, and that's what we have to deal with. So we do think and believe and we've said that's important. The pressure that we saw starting in '18 and continuing out into '19, we think that's abating. But we -- this is a business that has lived and will continue to live in the face of ongoing fee pressure, which is why we continue to be intensively focused on our operating model and how we build the business that can not only meet that, but that can become more and more profitable in that kind of environment.",neutral,0.2343,0.0779,0.6878
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brian, this is Eric. Let me add a little bit of a quantitative kind of estimation of exploring [ to help ] some on Ron's summary there. So on pricing, I think, as he said, historically, there's always been a 2 percentage point or so headwind on pricing per year over the last couple of decade. Two years ago, we saw that tick up 4% kind of headwind. That was kind of '17, '18. And then last year, if you think about '18 to '19, that was also 4% headwind, roughly speaking. And then I think we've described how we've been marching through a set of renegotiations and resetting of pricing over that kind of 8 to 10 quarter time period. 
As we look into our book of business and think about this coming year, what's factored into our outlook is approximately 3% pricing headwinds, so down from the 4%. And we've got some visibility, good visibility into first quarter and second quarter. And so that's factored into our outlook on servicing fee on a full year basis. 
To your point of where does mix come out, mix comes out in how we describe client flows and activity, and it's been relatively neutral. Activity is up a little bit with clients. Kind of transactional activity that flows, you're right, tend to work the other way around. So that's been a more neutral effect in aggregate relative to past history where it's been a slight positive of a point or 2. 
And then finally, on first quarter, you asked -- I'll just remind you that what I guided to on fees for the quarter was down 2% to 3% in aggregate for fees. The downdrafts that I noted were in management fees and in CRD. And so by omission, I didn't really cover servicing fees because we expect those to be flattish, and we'll see how they'll play out. But that's our current expectation.",negative,0.0362,0.8058,0.158
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Great. That's great color. And maybe then just on CRD, you guys reiterated the revenue and cost synergy outline that you had from day 1. I know that's mostly a 2021 impact in terms of where you want to be. Maybe just an update on sort of the time line into that or how you're thinking about 2020 in terms of part of that $260 million to $280 million revenue goal for '21. In other words, is that -- are you making material progress do you think in 2020 as it relates to your guidance there?",neutral,0.0783,0.0167,0.905
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Brian, it's Ron. I would say we absolutely are making material progress. And in terms of the synergies that we outlined, both revenue and cost, we expect those to play out -- purchase in the time frame that we described earlier. But the more important impact or the even greater impact of Charles River has been around how it's affecting our core business and changing the nature of the conversation and the relationships that we're having with our clients. 
As we noted, we signed 4 so-called front-to-back deals [ or ] Alpha platform in 2019. So in just over a year of ownership, we signed deals, which, in essence, means that we have a comprehensive and complete relationship with the client front-to-back. The pipeline there remains very strong. And even in those cases where the likely outcome is not a full front-to-back, it's changed the nature of how we're dealing with our clients from a one-off product provider to a true business process -- outsourcing partner with these clients, and I think that trend will carry on in many ways, fundamentally change the nature of our asset servicing business to the positive.",neutral,0.3529,0.0146,0.6325

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"I mean I'd expect it'll be largely linear, but with a bit of an uptick as we continue to build out the platform, I mean we announced over the year various platform partners that we've added to Alpha, and these are providers that are plugging into our platform and typically where we get a share of those economics. And I think you'll see at an increasing rate over '20 and '21 the number of those kinds of providers on the platform, and you'll see them -- the increasing importance of platform economics. And that will be less linear and more -- it's like how any platform grows, right? It starts out small and the momentum build as more and more become part of the platform.",neutral,0.1352,0.021,0.8438
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brian, it's Eric. Add to that, the -- if you think about the revenue trajectory on the synergies, for example, part of what you'll see is some of the leading indicators, like bookings, have started to tick up. You saw those were up 28% on a year-on-year basis. And so that's what will begin to drive the Charles River kind of specific revenues this year and next year. I think in contrast to that, some of the revenue synergies were around connections with the State Street base of revenues. And in particular, the trading and sponsored repo kind of revenue activity that we've quickly tried to link into Charles River tends to actually happen earlier in the 3-year cycle than later just because of the speed at which we can either make the client kind of connections or the order management system connection. So there'll be a mix. And I think sometime this year, we'll probably do maybe a more fulsome kind of where are we as we're 1.5 years, 2 years into this deal and try to share more information. It sounds like that would be helpful.",neutral,0.291,0.0254,0.6836

5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Eric, I wanted to just -- Eric, and I wanted to just dig in a little bit on some of the comments around the expenses. I think during the prepared remarks, you mentioned that there's more to come. And I would expect that, just wondering, should we anticipate that the pace of change, the rate of change of expense reductions, is it something you think you can continue for the next few years? Or is this 2020, we get the 1% down and then it's more hold it steady or continue to grow? So while I should say it to you, but grow in line with just core expense pressure. So I just wanted to get your understandings to the duration of your expectations around the more to come.",neutral,0.0965,0.0455,0.858
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Betsy, let me begin on that, and while we're not giving guidance beyond 2020 at this point, I would say that our ambition is to continue to manage expenses down, offset by the necessary investments that we need to make. We believe that there's more room for productivity improvement. Our automation efforts are underway, but we have much more in front of us than what we've accomplished. So we see a path to continued and ongoing expense management certainly through 2020 and likely beyond, is the way I would think about it. 
And part of that is we -- if you're going to win in this industry, that's what you need to do, right? We've talked about the servicing fee pressure, talked about the pressure that's on our clients, but it's also just about being able to scale at the level that we need to. I mean if you think about the amount of new business that we've brought in, the -- those assets could only have been brought in if there was confidence on the part of the client base that we would be able to scale that. And I just think that to be the leader in this business, we have to continue to get that productivity improvement driven by automation, driven by process redesign to be able to take on a business like that.",neutral,0.2252,0.0149,0.7598

45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Betsy, it's Eric. That was probably where I was going to go. I think we're quite conscious that in a slower top line growth environment, we're signaling 1% to 3% on fees this year. That's a year where you want to hold expenses, actually bring them down, right, because we need to create some real operating leverage and margin expansion. And so I think part of the answer to your question is if revenue growth is in that low single digits, then the expense is coming down, is the right answer. 
I think to your point and the precise question that if revenues take a downtick, whether it's interest rate-driven or something else on the equity markets or something, then we would go deeper into expenses and we ration our reinvestment and just do it at a -- perhaps at a different pace. We'd find ways to accelerate some of our other optimization efforts. You're seeing what we're doing in IT, for example, that we described in December. We'd go deeper there. And just think about where we were in January of 2019, we announced 1% down and felt like, through the middle of the year, the environment hadn't gotten appreciably different. And so we ended up with 2% down. I think that's the kind of incremental action we would find a way to deliver if the environment were not favorable.",negative,0.071,0.6301,0.2989

49,James Francis Mitchell,,"Maybe first question just on the CET1 ratio. Standardized, it jumped 60 basis points, look like a 5 billion reduction in RWAs. Kind of what drove that? And is there more to do there?",neutral,0.0622,0.0533,0.8844
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Jim, it's Eric. I think you're on the capital ratio pages where we've shown this quarter both standardized and advanced. And we did that because our binding constraint now is effectively both. They're almost right on top of one another. And I think you need to be a scientist to really understand the trend in each of those capital ratios. So let me try, and I'll -- we'll do a follow-up if necessary. 
So standardized, if you remember, is more volume-driven with some very -- relatively simplistic factors. And so the standardized ratio actually improved because standardized RWA fell sequentially, and that occurred, in particular, in the standardized RWA of our FX activities and our securities -- I'm sorry, our sec lending activities. And that's kind of related to the lower levels of volatility in the market and lower actions. So that was the biggest downward driver of standardized. 
If you take out your Ph.D. and want to think about advanced RWA, our advanced RWA went up, which is why the advanced ratio came down sequentially. And the advanced RWA increased because of loan growth and investment portfolio growth and a little bit of ops risk primarily. So those were -- it's a little bit apples and oranges, but that was the driver. I think from our perspective, we -- it just -- it's a good reminder that we live in a world of both, and we -- obviously, we'll manage to both. 
I think what I found comforting is, notwithstanding all our capital actions that we've taken and our higher payout, we actually are at real healthy capital levels, and that obviously gives us flexibility going forward. It sets us well -- it sets us up well for this cycle's CCAR, and we can take things from there.",neutral,0.3976,0.0703,0.5321
49,James Francis Mitchell,,"Absolutely, standardized is what matters for CCAR, and that going up is certainly a nice positive. So -- but maybe just the second question, following up on your guidance of kind of fee revenue growth of 1% to 3%. Just maybe to push back a little bit on it. If I look at 4Q fees and normalize for seasonality and processing fees and then just annualized 4Q, I get to almost 2% growth in 2020. So it doesn't feel like a very ambitious target when you think about the S&P is now currently 8% above 4Q average level. So you have a pretty big tailwind in the markets. You have about 3.5% of growth from AUC/A that's yet to be installed, the $1.1 trillion or $1.2 trillion is equivalent to 3.5% growth. You have the market tailwind, and you only have about 2% fee income growth. Is there something we're missing? I know you talked about the 3% reduction in the fee rate, but it seems like there could be a little better than that. And just please feel free to talk me down from that.",neutral,0.2231,0.0542,0.7228
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Jim, it's Eric. I'm trying to come up with a realistic forecast because, to be honest, we'd actually like to be realistic of what we're seeing. And we also want to -- maybe back to one of the earlier questions, if we're realistic on revenue, we'll do the right thing on expenses. And so both matter in this business. But I think this is a realistic forecast. And obviously, if something changes dramatically, we'll -- up or down, that could have an effect. But let me just go through the pieces, so that you have a sense. 
So on servicing fees, we said to the lower middle end of the 1% to 3% range. So I think that's pretty clear. I think if you think about it, the equity markets in the U.S. on average, and the averages matter here, will probably be up in the high single digits. So that'll provide a couple of percentage points tailwind in fees. There may be a little bit of -- there'll be obviously some amount of net new business, but there's also the fee headwinds still, that 3% that comes the other way that we need to overcome. And so that's why we get to the lower to middle end of the 1% or 3% range. 
And remember, there are some businesses that are, in servicing fees, that are driving very quickly. We've noted, for example, EMEA sometimes or some of the asset management space, but there are others like our hedge fund clients are actually tending to be relatively stable or even in downdraft in some cases. And so that works in different directions. So there are some puts and takes within the portfolio that we're always conscious of. I think on management fees, we said the upper end of that range, and I think you can square that with the lower step off in first quarter of 2020 that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. 
Trading. I think trading is trading right now. I think you've seen it kind of trend downwards over the last year. I think volatility doesn't feel like it's moving up fast. It's not moving up fast, right? It's stable at best, leverage from hedge funds or from those who borrow or lend in the sec finance business. If you look at the industry data, it's actually down year-on-year. And I don't see a quick turnaround for that. And so I don't want to gear a business model to an automatic recovery in trading volatility and opportunities to find wider margins and so forth. 
And then there's our software and processing fee other line, and I think we've given good, clear guidance on Charles River. And like you say, you just have to be careful about the annualization of the processing fees and other. I think just this quarter, processing fees and other were up about $25 higher than would have naturally been expected than a year ago quarter-over-quarter. And if you look at the full year, I think there's that or even a little more in full year '19 than in full year '18. So you may want to think about annualizing either both '18 and '19 or even look back to '18 just because there's a range of possibilities there.",neutral,0.0989,0.0981,0.803

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Great. A quick question on the guidance. You did mention that there was changes in leverage ratio coming forward. SCB could also be coming through.

I think what we do now is we know the amount of capital returns last year. We have some amount of view on this coming year, but we're still guessing. And so I -- it's -- I think what you should probably do from a modeling perspective and what we would expect you to do is think about the capital return levels that we've been at last year as at least a starting point. I'll let you take a swag if you wanted to add a little more or not at that. But at least start with last year as I think that gives some earnings accretion to the EPS line because of the retirement of shares, and that should factor into your estimates in our -- that does factor into your estimates presumably in our guidance.",neutral,0.068,0.037,0.895
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Okay. And then separately, when you mentioned the pricing headwinds in 2020 of 3%, is 3% the new normal? Or do you still expect that to go back towards the 2% level of a headwind that has been historically?",neutral,0.0628,0.1566,0.7806
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brian, it's Eric. That's a hard question to answer now. I think we'll have a better sense of that later this year in 2020 because what we will get to is where are we with clients with whom we need to adjust pricing in '17 and '18 or '16, some of those. They tend to be 3-, 5-, 7-year contracts. There'll be some that start to come through. I think there'll be some balance of trade discussions with those clients. There'll be some different types of deals we do in 2020 and '21. Think about the front-to-back deals have kind of a different patina to them, whether they come with more middle office or sometimes with a broader array of services that may not factor in differently. 
So I think it's just early to tell. I will certainly, I'm sure at this point next year, give some kind of indication for 2021. I think we'd like it to come back down to 2%, but we don't want to build a business model to that right now, which is probably why we've been so emphatic about, notwithstanding the fee growth that we're expecting this year, that we continue to want to reduce expenses in this plan.",neutral,0.1313,0.0734,0.7953

41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Just a quick one for me. You mentioned in the quarter some market-related adjustments in software fees. Curious just what that was and if material. And then in the 1Q fee outlook, what was the client mix item that you highlighted?",neutral,0.0469,0.0906,0.8625
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure. It's Eric, Mike. Let me take the first part of that. On the market-related items in the software and processing fees, there are several -- the larger ones are tied around the asset management business where there are kind of 2 underlying activities. There's an activity where we seed funds with our own capital. And obviously, if those funds do well or if there's an equity market uptake, you tend to have a positive mark-to-market because they're effectively on our balance sheet. 
The second one is we've got some compensation programs that tied -- that are tied to different investment vehicles. And because of how the accounting works those, and again, tied, it's, I think, relatively typical in asset management because the way the accounting works is you tend to have a mark-to-market effect and an accrual effect, but they tend to be at -- in different time periods. And so in appreciating markets as we had this year, they tend to be positive. In falling markets like we had at the very end of fourth quarter of '18, they were negative, and that's why we have a big swing. Those are the -- there are a couple of other smaller ones, but those are the lumpy items that we just effectively need to live with.",neutral,0.0671,0.084,0.8489

There -- we have a very large client where we do -- we have a comprehensive asset management relationship with them and like lots of other -- it's a large corporate. As it's derisking, it moves from risk on type of assets, which have a higher fee to fixed income and liability-driven kinds of investments, which have a lower fee.

18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"I have one question that addresses the headwind and one for the solution. So first, in terms of the problem pricing pressure, which you addressed, you said it's gone from 4% headwind to 3% headwind, maybe not 2%, but a little bit better. I guess isn't some of that improvement due to the runoff of low-margin BlackRock? And if you have assets to be installed equal to 3.5% of AUC, is that why you are conservatively guiding for 1% to 3% fee growth? And if the pricing pressure is really abating on a core level, why is that?",neutral,0.1254,0.0664,0.8082
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Mike, it's Eric. I think there are a couple of different pieces there on the pricing pressure. I think we try to be real distinct in our -- certainly internal analysis, but also our disclosure around pricing pressure relative to other drivers of the fee -- the servicing fee line. So the other drivers are net new business, which would include client transition or added business. There is -- we talked about flows and activity, which have been relatively modest. And then we talk about markets. So we talk about the different buckets consciously because it helps us better manage. 
And I think if you go through some of the description that I gave, the fee headwind, we do expect to be lighter from 4% this past year-over-year. In 2020, we expect it to be closer to 3%. I think we do expect some market uplift in 2020. That's in contrast to effectively no market uplift in 2019 if you look at the averages and you look at the averages around the world and average those. And then on net new business, which would include some of that, either added clients or the occasional transition out, we do expect that, that would be a bit positive in 2020 based on some of the last year of significant wins. And in 2019, to your point, it was actually flat in effect, and that was because of that client transition. So that's a little bit of a compare and contrast.",neutral,0.2349,0.0428,0.7223
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Mike, on your question on fee pressure itself, maybe the better way to describe it is we see the effects of fee pressure abating. I mean at some level, clients, of course, want to have the best fee proposition that they can. We've gotten better at managing that, and we've gotten better through the addition of additional services like Charles River and the Alpha platform of being able to respond to a fee reduction with a -- with either a consolidation of business, offsetting new business, a deeper and broader share of the wallet. 
So maybe the way to think about it is there's always ongoing fee pressure. And at times, that's higher or lower, but it's always there. In the meantime, we've gotten better at managing it, both in terms of how we actually go about managing, but also in terms of the additional services that we can now bring to bear.",neutral,0.4889,0.0209,0.4902
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"And then part of the solution to that, as you've mentioned, is getting more efficient, reduced head count 4 quarters in a row and really technology. So I know you just hired a new Chief Technology Officer, but if you could just give some sense of your technology priorities last year. Tech spending, I guess, went up 4% to $2.1 billion. Where do you expect the tech spend to go? 
And I know I've asked this. I asked this at the Annual Meeting last year, but you ended the decade with a 26% pretax margin and it was 29% when you first converted to the cloud.

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"So there's a lot in your question, Mike, and let me try and answer it efficiently. The focus last year was on, firstly, being ruthless in our prioritization of what was important and tying it much more closely to the needs of the business, firstly, our clients; secondly, what we needed to do for our operating model; and thirdly, what we needed to do for ongoing -- improving ongoing operational resiliency. We're very careful about the incremental investments we make, but we need to make incremental investments. 
That has set us up. That -- if you will, the actions we took in 2019 have set us up now to be focused on what we think are the right priorities. We let go some personnel that we felt just weren't consistent with the priorities that we've set. And now what we need to do is just get better at executing those priorities. We feel we've got a plan in place to do that. So what we told you is that you've seen our historic growth. Our intention is to bend that expense growth just like we've bent overall expense growth. We'll do that through a combination of continuing to reprioritize. The gross impact of that will be reasonably high, but it'll be offset by the investments that we need to make to continue to be positioned the way we want to be with our clients. So the net result of that will be a significant arresting of the growth, but we'll probably still be slightly up for the year, is the way I would think about it.",neutral,0.3315,0.0207,0.6479

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"So Rob, we are emphasizing that as a priority for a couple of reasons. Firstly, lots of the capabilities that we have are increasingly relevant to that space. The asset owner space in the distant past was much more of a custody only, maybe a little bit of accounting. And increasingly, asset owners of typical large and medium asset owner, firstly, is some form of an asset allocator. And in many cases, they have their own investment activities, alongside what they're doing with third parties. So it lends itself to the array of services that we have. The cycle time on them tends to be a little bit quicker, but it's a different selling cycle. If it involves public, it's a very prescribed selling cycle. So it's something that we believe we can leverage a lot of the capabilities that we have.

But we do think it will cause is -- with, if you will, transaction fees, no longer the primary criterion by many investors, we believe that it's going to -- that it should enable us to point investors to what they should be focused on, which is liquidity of the product, the true cost of moving in and out of the product. And we've got -- and despite a range, we've got some of the most actively traded products out there. Very liquid. In some cases, deeper and more liquid than the underlying assets.

But what's been particularly gratifying is that we have in the pipeline and working very much through them towards what we would expect to see mandate signed in 2020 or early '21. Clients where we had no relationship or just a very, very minor relationship where they see the advantage of being able to have a platform, and it might be all State Street products or might not, but a platform that integrates it all there and give them the ability to reengineer their own business model.

And I think it's those clients, the asset manager clients, in particular, that have actually borne the brunt of some of the challenges in the investment industry. And so in some ways, we're near to the bull's eye of where there's disruption in the investment industry, and that's been why I think we've been disproportionately impacted. It's kind of the effect of having that larger share position. 
I think we've always seen competitors come in and out of our industry, certainly, those in the other segments are envious of our position, asset managers, but I don't think it's as much a competition-driven change. There's always some of that, but I don't think it's as much of that. And I tell you, for every large competitor that's in the ascent, there's a large competitor who's beginning to fade and focus on other areas, or sometimes there's a small disruptor coming in.
