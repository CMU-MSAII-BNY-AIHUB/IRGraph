0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0423,0.0297,0.928
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Eric, interested to hear a little bit more about the plan to shift up the investment and the earning asset portfolio. What types of loans are you looking to grow? And how should we think about that as far as a change, proportionally? I think it might be helpful to sort of base a little bit of that.",neutral,0.1055,0.0133,0.8812
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brennan. It's Eric. Let me describe a little bit of our intentions here. Clearly, as we enter this market with rising rates, right, it's a natural time for us to consider how much to keep in non-HQLA assets versus other interests earning assets. We've made a choice to continue to optimize that part of the balance sheet. And what you'll see us doing over time is shifting some of that into interest earning assets for clients, right? And I'll -- some of that will be lending, as you've asked about, I'll come back to that in a moment. Some of that will support the Enhanced Custody business, some of that will support our other activities. And then another portion will just we reinvested in interest earning assets that are HQLA qualifying, and thereby, balance of the balance sheet. So I think you'll see us continue to design the balance sheet in a way that supports multiple objectives. In terms of lending, our lending growth, and you see mid-teen lending growth over the last year has been consistent over the last couple of years. We lend to 40 Act Funds, we lend to the parent companies of some of our large clients, we do capital call financing for some of our private equity clients. And so, that's the kind of, I'll call it near-end lending that will be -- that'll continue to be the core of what we do. And our perspective is that some of that lending is remunerative on its own. Some of that lending is actually positive, because it gives us an extra way to interact and to connect with our clients. And that's something that they value. And sometimes actually ask for as part of the servicing mandates or others that we participate in.",neutral,0.108,0.0172,0.8747
6,Brennan Hawken,,"That makes a lot of sense actually. And it seems like a good way to expand out the relationship.  So another question on the balance sheet. And it seemed like you implied it in your prepared remarks, Eric, but please correct me if I'm wrong. It seems like the balance sheet and the average deposit balances grew here similar to the peers. But seems as though there is sustained appetite there. And so am I correct in implying that we shouldn't necessarily think about that reverting from what was a pretty strong growth rate here this quarter? And you think that, that could sustain, or at least the indication so far looks like it's pretty durable here?",positive,0.826,0.0253,0.1486
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brennan, yes, I think the way to think about our balance sheet growth is that you dial back 3 years, we needed to compress the size of our balance sheet and kind of focus of the most valuable part of the funding of the deposits that we had. And we did that like many others. I think last year, we felt like we had also seen another tick up in balances, in some currencies and some overall balances. And we felt like we had to continue to trim and make it more compact and kind of more higher NIM generating. I think we've gotten to a point over the last couple of quarters where we're comfortable with the size of our balance sheet and we've signaled, as part of the January outlook, that we're comfortable with modest growth. And so you saw a little bit of that, quarter-on-quarter. The trimming of the investment portfolio gives us an ability to do that. Deposits now in dollars, in particular, come in at healthy margins. And it's yet another way to engage with all of our clients, whether it's the asset managers, whether it's the alternative providers, whether it's some of the FX counterparties. They all value the ability to leave their cash with such a highly rated counterparty. And our perspective is, that's part of what we can do and should do. And if you come full circle, that's a good service for them and provides good earnings and earnings growth for us.",positive,0.5593,0.0238,0.4169
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,neutral,0.0332,0.0505,0.9163
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"If we could talk about the new business wins. So talk about what they're engaging you on? Is it new versus existing clients, fee rate relative to overall maybe you could go through a little bit of that?",neutral,0.0859,0.02,0.8941
47,Joseph L. Hooley,,"Sure, Glenn. This is Jay. I'll start and Eric can jump in. Obviously, an outsized quarter, this quarter for new business commitments, at the $1.3 trillion. And not surprisingly, there's a couple of big deals embedded within that. I would say, general themes are clients consolidating with fewer providers. So of the two big deals, one represented that, a global player that operates in many different geographies and chose to consolidate with State Street, which is terrific. The other big deal represented a large client that decided for the first time to outsource fund accounting and administration. Which I think just speaks to the ongoing challenge that the asset management industry is having and looking for ways to get more efficient, outsource more activities. So that represented a little bit of the outlier growth in the quarter. I would say, maybe more generally, Glenn, that the pipelines and the new business that we committed is pretty diverse. Little concentration in Europe, which continues to be a -- an outperformer in the offshore marketplace. ETFs, as a service provider to ETFs, we think we have a very differentiated proposition. So ETFs continue to be a theme. But across the geographies, well balanced. Final point I'd make before I give Eric a shot is that in the 2 big deals that we -- that were embedded in the quarter. They both went very deep in their diligence looking at, as you'd expect, State Street's capabilities. And Beacon featured very positively. As people get in and peel back the covers and understand the investments that we're making and how we view the future around consolidating back, middle, front office, it's really a differentiator. So in one of those in particular, I don't remember being examined the way we were examined by that prospective client. And the deeper they got, the better we looked. So I'd say that it's reinforcing to me, the efforts of Beacon, not just to create more efficiencies, but when clients take a look at us, they really understand that we are investing for the future. And we do have a vision about how this business is going to look over time. Eric, would you add anything?",neutral,0.1527,0.0172,0.8301
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Glenn, I'd just add that, it showed some real positive momentum of the business. I'd just be careful. It's hard to model how and when that hits. Some new business comes in right away. Some of the simpler activity. Some of the more complex stuff takes time. We're not going to, in any particular quarter, give guidance as to when this stuff is going to get installed or not. I think we're just going to overdo it then. But there is a range, right? Sometimes you bring on an alternative mandate and you get 5 or 6 bps because of the fee structure. Sometimes it comes on as custody accounting administration, so you get what might be typical in terms of fee yield. And sometimes, you might just get custody because there may be other activities in discussion or possible down the road. And so you start with your foot in the door, so to speak. And that comes at a fraction of the typical or the average fee rate. So there is a mix there. I think it's nice positive momentum from a business standpoint, which makes us feel good about the progress and successes to-date.",neutral,0.0811,0.0255,0.8934
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Okay. One tiny follow-up. Eric, on the balance sheet. It seems like you got more fixed rate versus floating. As rates are rising, just not as intuitive as I would have thought. Just -- I'm sure it's much more involved than that.",neutral,0.1874,0.0237,0.7889
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Glenn. Good observation, what the -- the immediate change that you noticed, which is really just a quarter-on-quarter change on the asset side of the balance sheet. So we'll come back on the liabilities. So on the asset side as we sold down the non-HQLA securities, the bulk of those were credit instruments. Credit instruments tend to be floating rate. So the mix changed, just in kind of a percentage nature, not in a dollar amount. We've continued to maintain, though, the asset-sensitive balance sheet that we've had. And we feel good about that. That's paid out nicely over the last 2 years and -- so our asset sensitivity still remains in the range where we'll -- where we're positioned for a rising rates, in particular, at the short end of the curve.",neutral,0.2763,0.0303,0.6935
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0344,0.0305,0.9351
4,Alexander Blostein,,"I want to start off with, just talking about the operating leverage dynamic in the quarter. So I, understand the FX swap dynamic. Obviously, Eric, to your point, attracted about 1 percentage point from operating leverage on the fee side. So adjusted modestly positive, but again albeit, very modest especially in the light of pretty strong equity markets and improving volumes. So maybe go through a little more what's going on there? Anything that drove, in particular, sort of muted operating leverage on the fee side this quarter. I don't know if it's just the sizable wins that might have suppressed some of that a little bit. So just help us understand how to think through the fee operating leverage through the rest of the year.",neutral,0.3733,0.079,0.5477
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Alex. Fair question. There's always variability quarter-on-quarter on both the revenue side and the expense side. You saw that on the revenue side with the FX swaps. And in that processing other line that we have, it's really the kind of all other line. Every bank has that somewhere in their books. And so you have the swaps. And then we had slightly better results from that line a year ago. Slightly below average this year. And so the year-on-year actually got accentuated. You have other stuff in there, small stuff. You have the mark-to-mark on the seed capital for a new asset management fund, which was positive a year ago. You've got the tax advantage investments and how much they run through revenue. On the negative side, that was less negative a year ago. So you kind of have those puts and takes. And that's why in addition to the FX swap, we saw lower than typical processing in other line and that impacted the top line part of operating leverage by 1 point for FX swaps. And then there is another point but it's small stuff, which we don't like to get into, but just tends to play through. On the expense side, if you think through expenses, you've got to keep an eye on currency translation, keep an eye on the accounting, the revenue recognition accounting standard and then the absence of restructuring, underlying expenses were up 4%. That's the normalized fine given the revenue momentum in the business, but came in just a little more than it may in a typical quarter. So we had some of the ramp-up cost, as you mentioned, of new business, right? And that kind of have some ebbs and flows. But if you could imagine, as you bring on new business, before you bring it on, you've got to run in parallel. Before you run in parallel, you've got a set up. Some of that is technology cost, which is typically expense. Some of that is people, some of that is underlying processing. And so there are periods where 1 quarter or even 2 quarters ahead, we can pick up some expenses in advance of the revenues. And then we also had, I noted, some higher sub-custody fees, if you have noticed, emerging markets were up almost 30%. That's where sub-custodians are. And so that ends up being a little higher than this particular quarter. So anyway, there is some variability, I think, in the -- on the revenue -- on the fee revenue line. There is a little bit of variability in the expense line. We're pleased with the overall momentum. And as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, we're committed to our full year fee operating leverage within that range that we have provided at this point.",neutral,0.1195,0.0763,0.8042
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. Okay. So no real change there. And then the second question for me, I guess, just around some of the NIR dynamics. I guess one, maybe we could hit on the deposit beta. Obviously, cost seem to be pretty well controlled on the U.S. side for quite some time, frankly, as well. So maybe talk a little bit about what were the deposit betas on the U.S. side and why they're so much lower than for your peers? And then maybe just to kind of round out the whole conversation around processing fee versus NIR. Do I hear you correctly that, I guess, if the [ FX ] cost go away, roughly $10-ish million drag this quarter, so processing fees steps up about $10 million but then NIR goes down $10 million?",neutral,0.0961,0.2598,0.6441
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Let me take those questions in the order that you asked. So betas came in reasonably well relative to expectations. So we've been signaling that they've been floating up. We had betas in the U.S. in the low 40% range, which is kind of right where we had, thought they would come. That's up from last, I guess, the last rates hike we had. We had it about 25%. So we're kind of in -- we've been moving up in line with our expectations. The part of the balance sheet that performs better than expectation was actually that transition from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, was actually slower than we've continued to model. And so if you think about interest-bearing betas are at expectations or even a bit better. But total deposit betas, right, because that's what really matters, has come in better than expected. And I think if I step back, I think that's in the range of what we've seen in peers. I think you see some types of deposits are -- that corporate deposit money, very high beta. Or the wealth management money, very high beta. The retail is very low beta and we tend to be in the middle as a custody bank. And so we've been pleased with those results. And finally, just on the FX swaps, that's -- you've got it right. They -- instead of being in NIR, that FX swap cost, that ended up in processing fees. If they had qualified for hedge accounting, they would've been in the other line. I think going forward, we -- our intention is certainly to put as much as possible into the NII line by making sure they qualify for hedge accounting. But even more importantly, our perspective is, we should bring down the volumes of FX swaps. They were up at the -- the kind of $15 billion to $20 billion level. They're now in the $10 billion to $15 billion level and actually trending at the lower end of that range. Our intention in the coming quarter is to bring down even further. And as we've trimmed the investment portfolio by trimming the dollar portion of the investment portfolio on the non-HQLA side, that actually, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, can actually bring down the swaps further. So our perspective is to align the balance sheet over time, so that it's as currency matched as possible. That'll bring the swap cost down. And in fact, it will give us over time, the ability to take advantage of swap dislocations and actually do a little bit better depend -- one way or the other.",neutral,0.2071,0.0796,0.7133
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0374,0.0419,0.9207
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Maybe just to go back on the -- one more on the balance sheet. The end-of-period balance sheet, obviously, was a lot higher. As a big step up and a big difference from the average balance sheet. I know there's always a lot of quarter-end noise. But maybe, Eric, if you can, sort of, comment on whether you think that reverts and we should be looking at the sort of the trend line on the average balance sheet. And also on the noninterest-bearing side, that spiked up. It looks like about -- by about $10 billion. So I just want to make sure we're normalizing that. And then on the swap, I think that's out of the non-U.S. deposit side, it's $22 million if I'm not mistaken. And would that make it more like an 18 basis point core rate instead of a 7 basis point core rate on that?",neutral,0.1553,0.0418,0.8028
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Let me start on the balance sheet. And then I'd just -- I'll actually to clarify the swap question a little bit more. On the balance sheet, we do get, on a daily basis and then an [ intra-quarter ] basis, we do get higher deposit balances. And if you think about the very largest of our asset manager and pension clients, that is quite typical. I don't think this quarter was any different than the other quarter ends other than it ended on a Good Friday. And that, in some cases, creates a little more cash on our balance sheet. But there's nothing -- there was nothing unique about the quarter end which signals any changes really on the average balance sheet. The average balance sheet, as I described, I think is moving in the right direction. I think we've got good client engagement. We've got a good sharing of the benefits of the rate rises with our clients and we continue to engage them in making sure that, that's fair on both sides. And as I said earlier, our perspective is our balance sheet. It's something we can put to work on the -- for the benefit of our clients, and we're going to keep doing that. That's a nice way to supplement the fee revenue that we have in this business. Do you want to just clarify a little more on your second question?",neutral,0.1711,0.0305,0.7984
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Yes, all I did was added the $22 million of the swap cost to the non-interest -- I'm sorry, to the non-U.S deposit line. And that would take that rate from 7 basis points that you published in your average balance sheet to that 18 basis points to sort of establish a core rate. Is that accurate? Is that -- am I -- is the geography correct in where I'm putting that?",neutral,0.0742,0.0428,0.883
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Let me -- why don't we have the IR team follow up off-line. I think you're -- there is a 2 parts of the answer to that question. First, the FX swap costs were $15 million this quarter and there was a $7 million benefit a year ago. So the $22 million I called out, the delta year-on-year. So you've got to adjust for the absolutes. So then we can work with you on the line item part of the balance sheet. I think directionally, it should go against the non-U.S. domicile deposits. I'll remind you, this is a domiciled view of deposits, not the currency view. Sometimes, those are similar. Sometimes, those are not. So it's -- you've got to be careful there. And we do have some extra footnotes at the bottom of that average balance sheet page of the supplement to try to help. But why don't we just do that offline with you and help with the modeling.",neutral,0.0761,0.0318,0.8922
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Yes, sure. Perfect. And then the follow-up would be on backup to the wins, the $1.3 trillion, sounds like the bulk of that is in 2 clients, Jay. Sometimes I know you -- I don't know if you've announced the actual clients. It'd be great if you could say those. If not, the -- just understanding, once again, the nature of that business. I think you mentioned one is a mutual funds accounting administration. And I forget, did you say the other was a mid-office? And effectively, from an AUC level or AUA level, it looks like it offsets the BlackRock loss, and should we be thinking of this coming in, overall, as a higher yield than the BlackRock loss?",neutral,0.0662,0.0292,0.9046
47,Joseph L. Hooley,,"Yes, let me take that, Brian. We -- we're not in a position to name names. But you have it, right, that there are a couple of meaty transactions which make up the bulk of that $1.3 trillion. And they're both kind of multidimensional. I described one as multi-geographic of full custody, admin, middle-office. Both existing clients that we had a small piece of. And then the other really represents more of a custody fund accounting fund admin, mostly U.S. And these will feather in over the course of the next year with component parts along the way till we get it fully implemented. But I think I'd go back to my point, they do represent what I've been saying all along, which is the -- we're getting more clients that are consolidating with fewer providers. And increasingly the pressure felt by the asset management industry on multiple dimensions, the active to passive, the regulatory pressure they're feeling. Both of these clients, by the way, took advantage of our new capabilities and liquidity, monthly liquidity reporting, which is a new SEC requirement. So I think it's more outsourcing. It's more consolidation. All good news. And we also had our typical range of new business, as I mentioned, across hedge, across ETF, offshore domicile. So a really good momentum. You mentioned the BlackRock offset, I mean, they -- all of this kind of offsets, generally, the BlackRock outflow, which I think we said will kind of commence somewhere mid-year and that'll take one year to roll out as well. So it all -- collectively, it gives us greater confidence in our ability to meet the guidance that we provided on service fee growth rates for 2018.",neutral,0.2436,0.018,0.7385
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,And is it fair to say it's a richer revenue yield than the BlackRock loss?,neutral,0.2842,0.034,0.6818

0,Operator,,Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.,neutral,0.0323,0.0367,0.931
48,James Francis Mitchell,,"Maybe just following up on that. I guess, Jay, what's your sense of sort of your active discussions or pipeline right now? Do you feel like it's stronger than it has been? Just kind of get a sense of the environment. Obviously, you had a very good quarter today on a couple of big wins. So how do we think about your pipeline and thoughts on it going forward?",neutral,0.1122,0.0198,0.8681
47,Joseph L. Hooley,,"I would say, Jim, it's been steady and quite positive. So I don't -- these 2 transactions may be a little bit of an outlier. But we continue to see opportunities across the spectrum. And we'll continue to be positioned, and whether it's the alternative world, the ETF world or traditional fund world. Folks consolidating, doing more. The more outsourcing piece, which Brian's question got into a little bit. There's more middle office activity. There is increasing interest in having us wire together the back office and the middle office. Through DataGX, we're offering new database analytics services. I mentioned the liquidity stress testing. So the environment is such that not only asset managers but also asset owners, big pension funds are craving more outsourcing, more analytics, more ability to respond to regulatory requirements. So it's -- you might say at, one level, it's mixed, and that there is a lot of pressure in our client set. And that comes with normal pressures back to us. But it's also -- it also comes with pretty steady opportunity to do more for them. And some of the -- the reference to spend on technology is designed to stay ahead of the new product opportunities, which are pretty vast as well. So strong, broad environment for new business. No real change. I don't see it letting up either.",neutral,0.2758,0.0154,0.7088
48,James Francis Mitchell,,"Okay, that's really helpful. And then maybe for Eric, to be a dead horse on the balance sheet. But you guys were the only one of your peers to see deposits grow and grow pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter at period end. You're sort of signaling maybe continued growth in average assets when others are signaling declines. So is it -- are you competing on price? I mean how do we think about what you're seeing and how you're attracting those deposits versus what your peers are seeing?",neutral,0.1201,0.2136,0.6663
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Jim, there's, I think, part of the -- there are a couple of things going on. There is the quarter end spikes versus the averages. There is a natural seasonality in the deposits as well that I think some of the others have referenced. January, February, tends to be higher. And then March a little lighter. So there is that trend, which I've heard, mentioned outside and we obviously see some version of that are custody books are similar enough. So I wouldn't read too much into the end of period or the monthly. I mean deposits tend to ebb and flow. The discussions we've had with clients are not strictly on price. I mean they shouldn't be and we don't want them to be and that in fact clients -- if that's not the client that we are looking for and vice versa. Because then it ends up being hot money. I mean we do tier pricing, right? Appropriately for larger clients versus smaller ones, we differentiate dollars and other currencies. There are relationships there that we engage in, but it's part of the relationship. It's part of the -- all clients have immediate cash that move around all the time. They have cash that's somewhat stable. There is some cash they sweep in institutional money market funds that we support through our asset management arm, right? They all have a waterfall of cash and cash availability and our perspective is we should engage with them on that, but price is a result of a lot of other things. It tends to not be something we lead it with and we won't lead with. It's -- and in fact, I think if you look at the underlying pricing and betas and so forth that we described in the U.S. market, which is the easiest for all of you to take a look at, we've actually been disciplined on deposit pricing and our view is we'll -- we should continue to do that.",neutral,0.0722,0.0408,0.8871

0,Operator,,This question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,neutral,0.035,0.0515,0.9136
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"I think I'm in a state of cognitive dissonance over your results. If you can help me out. On the negative side, I mean, you had tried the Beacon for few years. And Jay, you've had restructuring all decade. And it's great to hear Beacon savings. But then you have all these expenses for the new business wins and compensation and tech spend. And I thought one purpose for Beacon was to be able to put more business on more efficiently. And headcount is up 7% year-over-year. That way surpasses peers. Expense growth, certainly at more than I think some had expected this quarter. So that's the negative feeling I have. I guess on the other hand, the positive feeling is double-digit organic client growth in the first quarter, which was great. So I'm trying to reconcile those two thoughts, and I think the answer comes in what you've said about the lag between adding new business and getting all the revenues from that. I can't remember when that's had this much of an impact before. So if you can at least quantify the extra expenses this quarter, what kind of revenues you expect or give a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful.",neutral,0.4716,0.0376,0.4908
47,Joseph L. Hooley,,"Sure. Happy to do that, Mike. This is Jay. And I'll quickly route -- ladle this to Eric. But we don't measure life by a quarter. We're confidently investing. We're bringing on new clients. Beacon is a multiyear journey. We're tracking against our operating leverage goal as we said a few times, we are determined to achieve our fee operating goal in 2018. So things can come and go in a quarter. But we're investing in this business. And we're investing to bring on new clients. We're investing to make sure that we have those products that ultimately will differentiate and allow us to continue to grow. And that's not just an asset servicing, that's an asset management. So as Eric referenced and he'll go over again, you can get some episodic revenue and expense situations in a quarter. But we're thrilled with 5% operating leverage. We're thrilled with our top line. Our -- we're pretty happy about our market-based activity and the revenues that's driving. And we're going to make sure that we spend what we need to spend in order to bring those clients in successfully and stay ahead of the pack with regard to competing in these businesses. But, Eric, you might want to?",neutral,0.312,0.0123,0.6757
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Mike, I'll might just add to that, as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks but also in some of the Q&A, right? The expenses do have a little bit of variability to them, we talk about the ramp-up cost and those come and go and that's kind of the installation, right? And some of that can't be quite Beacon-ized away, because it takes custom effort to plug client in, especially some of our largest clients, remember are quite bespoke and unique and so connecting them take some effort. I mentioned the sub-custody fees, which were higher this quarter as emerging markets, as we saw more flows in emerging markets, we ended up with more volumes there. And the market levels take through. And then as you saw we continue to invest carefully in the tax spend law and you see us float up purposely because we see headroom on the revenues. We want to spend some on the -- we want to spend some on for client functionality and product development and so forth. I will remind you and the others, that first quarter expenses typically are up relative to fourth quarter by about $150 million because of that seasonal effect, the deferred incentive comp which comes through, in one way, once a year. So just keep an eye on that as you think about the modeling, right? This is not the new run rate, this is -- exactly not know what it is. And then finally, you mentioned headcount. It's something we actively manage. Overall headcount is up, as you pointed out, 6% to 7% range. High cost location headcount is actually down 3%, which is a purposeful movement from the -- some of our geographies to others.

45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"I think there's always going to be some expense and revenue variability. I think one way to think about it, Mike, is we gave an operating leverage range for the full year, right? That we committed to 75 basis points to 150 basis points on a fee operating leverage basis. So on a full year basis, you can imagine there is 75 basis points of variability. On a particular quarter, right? There can easily be a variability of a percentage point on expenses, right, one way or the other. And that's just the envelope in which we operate. And what we're trying to do is do the right thing by the business over time, by quarter and by year. But we want to do that in a considered manner.",neutral,0.0703,0.041,0.8886

10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"Jay, can you share with us these business wins that you had this quarter, which of course, were outsized? And you shared already that, as the customers dug into the way you guys are operating, they like even more of what they saw. Can you now extrapolate that the pricing. Are you able to price these types of products better or is it still very -- I know pricing has always been competitive for as long as you've been at State Street. Or was it just as competitive as always?",neutral,0.1498,0.0225,0.8277
47,Joseph L. Hooley,,"Yes, let me try to unpack that, Gerard. The -- I think that as a general theme, it's always been true that the more complicated the transaction is, the better the pricing. And that may sound counterintuitive. But I think when you have commoditized activity throughout the bid, there's a lot of people that can compete. And when there is a lot of people, pricing gets more difficult. The -- I'll just give you a couple of vignettes. The one deal that we talked about crosses 3 different geographies and it's very complicated. It's a very involved service model where you've got trading desks in a couple of different locations, you've got product servicing capability in other 3 locations, it's middle office, back office. So that narrows the field as far as the number of folks that can compete. And as a result, pricing gets better. And I'd say that's the theme generally holds. I think another vignette would be when somebody is doing this work on their own and they're making a decision to outsource it, which is another one of the situations that I had referenced. And that gets a little bit more complicated because try to -- understanding what ones internal cost are becomes a factor. But I would say, in that case, it was really less about cost, more about the -- they want to get out of the risky business of doing fund accounting globally at scale across a number of different products. So I think it still holds true that the more involved the activity is by geographies and by layers of service moving back towards the front office, generally the better pricing gets. I don't know if that's helpful.",neutral,0.0752,0.0538,0.871
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"No, no. That's is. And then, Eric, you gave us some good color on your capital ratios and you've mentioned about the RWA growth due to higher client overdrafts. A couple of questions on that. Do you know what drove the client overdrafts since they appear to be pretty material since the CET1 ratio did fall sequentially by a fair amount? And then second, when you look at our net interest revenue numbers, the incremental growth that you saw, how much was due to those overdrafts?",neutral,0.0928,0.2276,0.6795
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure, Gerard. The overdrafts, that totaled about $5 billion on our undrawn committed lines. That's not a large number. But it's large relative to what's typical. We've had the spikes in overdrafts. We've had them when there are either -- sometimes -- when you have storms and weather events, when you have holidays. This one in particular, if you remember we had Good Friday at the end of the quarter. The markets aren't -- half of the markets are open, half are not open. And so what happens is you kind of have a little bit of a discontinuity for clients who end up ahead, and one part of their funds short on the other and so draw on their lines. Which is why, to be honest, those lines exist, right? We're there for our clients. And are they're delighted to help them as needed. It was literally 2, 3, 4, 5 clients. So a handful. We know them well. We've supported them. And they've been good to us. So it's the kind of thing that will just occasionally happen. We don't expect it every quarter end. But occasionally, when something is in the environment, like the -- like in this case, it was a holiday and a quarter-end, you have an effect. In terms of NII, there is not a big effect, because remember NII is driven by average balances over the course of the quarter, right? So all 90 days. Not one day. So this wouldn't have had a big impact positive to NII. This is really a client accommodation that we're doing. And we're there for our clients. And one of the reasons we've got such strong balance sheet is so that we can accommodate clients like that. And that's the kind of expectation they have, for example, on some of the -- some of those larger clients that Jay described have for a custodial bank like us.",neutral,0.0698,0.0709,0.8593

9,Geoffrey Elliott,,"You touched on some of the proposed regulatory changes earlier. Can you elaborate a bit on, if we get the CCAR changes plus the SLR changes as proposed, what you think your new binding constraints on capital would be?",neutral,0.0438,0.0196,0.9366
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Geoffrey, it's Eric. I mean that's been a well-studied and modeled endeavor. And I say that in a nice way, because it's obviously important to us. It's obviously important to many if you and I think your team and other teams have tried to take that the new CCAR, [ NPR ], the one with the stressed capital buffer and say look, if you had a reformatted State Street and all the other bank results back to the last CCAR, how would it played out. I think as you know, our CCAR binding constraints or let me step back or binding constraints today from a capital perspective start with Tier 1 leverage then depending on kind of where we are it could be either CET1 or SLR. But that kind of core Tier 1 leverage is the binding constraint. I think the early modeling that we've seen and I think the modeling that the industry has done is not particularly different than ours is that with the SCB and the implementation the SCB across the various those 5 core capital ratios. It seems like the binding constraint will move from the standard Tier 1 leverage to CET1. That should create some amount of capacity. It's hard to model it precisely, but it seems to create some amount of capacity. And I think others have observed, it kind of does the right thing for banks, which is risk-weighted asset, should I actually be the dominant capital constraint for any bank, right? That's what a bank is about. The leverage ratio so if there's Tier 1 leverage or SLR should be the backstop. And I think the proposal is both well-intentioned, well-designed. There are obviously some refinements, but I'm sure we will suggest and now they'd also suggest but clearly going in the right direction.",neutral,0.0924,0.023,0.8846

When the outlook changes, we'll do a new slide and thereby, kind of adjust our messaging. What I will do and I did verbally this quarter is if quarter-on-quarter there always some seasonality or other swings, I'll signal those verbally. But no message at all. We're just trying to keep the slide deck compact to save an extra tree in the process. And -- but the full year outlook commitment that we made in January, our minds is a commitment.

5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Just 2 questions. One is on the proposed changes that you just discussed. And it seems like you have 2 potential options. Obviously, you can do a mix of each. But 2 basic options. One is, you have more capacity to take in deposits, grow the balance sheet even further or the other one is reduce the pref outstanding. And you've got some of the callable prefs that are out there today. Do you have a preference for either one or could you give us a sense of percentage that you'd want to do with either one?",neutral,0.1304,0.024,0.8456
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Betsy, it's Eric. I think at this point it's little premature to make a choice there. I think the rules are -- the rules as they stand are obviously, constraining in a certain way. I think the SCB, the CCAR SCB proposal and SLR proposals moved in the right direction. There's also the TLAC proposal, which we think is -- it's constructive. I mean not huge amounts, but at least constructive directionally. I think what we'll have to see is how they all come together and remember, they may come together little differently in each CCAR period, right? Because the notion of the stress and how the stress impacts us will be different. And also, we don't know if -- the Fed models are still fairly opaque, right? We don't know how they really modeled the balance sheet, how they really modeled the PPNR given that they signal -- they're going to change in and not close the balance sheets as much. And so every one of those -- so I don't mean to avoid the question but I think you've got the right levers, which is we could add to the deposit base or other balance sheet, kind of leverage balance sheet intensive activities like some sec lending or enhanced custody qualify. We could reduce the prefs and some of them are callable today, some of them will be callable next year and the year after and so forth. If that one is the binding constraint, right, we'll be disciplined around RWAs, right? And depending upon how much capacity you want to create there with, as we did this quarter with changes in non-HQLA in the investment portfolio, which have RWA will be under consideration. So in a way, I think there's a lot of optionality that this would create and no firm views at this point. But in my mind, it's the kind of thing, we'll optimize against, it's a better set of -- I think it's a better designed set of rules. And we'll have the view of how to do that from -- I think from a shareholder perspective, which is how do we turned out optimization to higher earnings and earnings growth, how do we turn that into capital and capital return, that'll be the length that we'll use.",neutral,0.0667,0.0292,0.9041

45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"It's not dollar-for-dollar, right? Because some of those securities are 50% risk-weighted. Some closer to 100%.

There's clearly a prioritization. We have to make sure it comes with good returns or good wallet, share of wallet from the client.

41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Eric, just one quick one. When I look at the fee revenue growth year-over-year, you guys had the 8%, like 5% ex FX. And then I think ex the revenue the recognition accounting that's 3%. To me, you're around 2%. And I know the processing, other, that can add like 3 -- like that can take that 2% to 3% or 4%. It just -- it seems like that's still maybe on the lighter side, just given the markets strength that we saw over the last 12 months. And then also the volatility that we saw in the quarter that helped the trading side. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out, is there anything else you know that may be we're missing, that may be muted growth or is it really just all the processing and other, because it still seems maybe a little bit lighter than you would've expected?",neutral,0.123,0.0792,0.7978
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Mike, it's Eric. Let me -- I mean I think Page 7 of the earnings deck that you'll have is probably a good one to take a quick look at. I think the -- we're quite circumspect with how we show the revenues. We show with and without currency translation, we actually do it on the slide so you can find them and I just encourage you to make sure all of the comparisons are apples-to-apples and you've got enough footnotes here to adjust for revenue recognition. I think the single biggest driver of our revenues is the servicing fees, right? That's half of our total revenues, $5 billion a year, and the $11 billion, $10 billion to $11 billion of revenues. And so I think we're quite pleased with a 10% nominal growth there, and the 6% adjusted for currency translation. And there is no meaningful revenue recognition in there. So that's quite solid. And that -- last year -- right now, it's half of our revenue, last year it was up 4% adjusted for currency on a full year basis and been about that range. So we're pleased with that. Every quarter will be a little different variable. But that's a good performance. I think some of the other rows: management fees, trading, securities, finance, came in more or less in line with expectations, and I do think processing/other is the biggest disconnect. Remember year ago we had a gain on sales $30 so that costs 1.5 points. You had the FX swaps delta, which was $22 million. And then if you still do the comparison between the year-on-year, there is another, [ 20, 25 ] of just small ins and outs that tended to add a positive last year and negative this year. So I don't think you're missing anything. I think there's just some variability here on that line. And it went against us this quarter, it will tend to be neutral in other quarters and positive in still others. So overall, I think we feel like there's good momentum in the business. We're pleased with the result, line item geography was a little bit unfortunate on the FX swaps, but nice way in our minds to start the year, good step off and we're obviously working on the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter.",neutral,0.3198,0.0808,0.5994
