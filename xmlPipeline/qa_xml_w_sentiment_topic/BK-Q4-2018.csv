0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,neutral,0.0466,0.0227,0.9307
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Just one clarification that I know will come up. When you guys are talking about reasonable EPS growth this year, just can you just level set us on your starting point? Is that off of a GAAP basis? Or is it off of your adjusted basis?",neutral,0.0436,0.0623,0.8942
1,Charles W. Scharf,,It's off an adjusted basis.,negative,0.0287,0.7172,0.2542
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"So off of the $4.21 basis, you'd expect EPS growth?",neutral,0.198,0.025,0.7771
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Well, again, I mean, that is what we're shooting for. Obviously, it depends on what the market is, but that's absolutely true.",neutral,0.0834,0.0169,0.8996
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay, okay. And secondly then, to your point also about not increasing expenses by much, is the thought that you have on 1% to 2% year-over-year in the first quarter the generic way we should be thinking about expenses over the course? Or does something change with the trajectory as the severance benefit -- the benefits from the severance you took starts to layer in against future investments?",neutral,0.0841,0.0885,0.8274
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. I think -- I don't think we want to give you a number for the full year. Otherwise, we would have. But I think the way you're thinking about it is right, which is the benefits that we will get on the severance actions that we've taken this quarter will really start second quarter and then in the second half of the year. And so there'll be more benefits in that period of time. So overall, again, I think the words are the words that we intended to use. It's obviously early, but I think the point we want to make sure you understand is -- number one, is we're highly, highly focused on driving efficiency inside the company. We think that -- and I described this before, that when we -- when you take actions, the next set of actions become even clearer. And so that is something that, in our business, we're going to continue to do. And we're going to do it at the same time that we are going to increase the spend where we need to expend it. So all in all, we feel very good about our ability to really control expenses while investing where we think we need to next year.",neutral,0.2083,0.0166,0.7751
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. And then just to clarify, when you -- do you expect like the gap between your GAAP expenses and adjusted expenses to narrow? Like do you expect as many of these noncore notable items as you go forward? Are we going to see like these big severance things every quarter? I guess that's the question.",neutral,0.072,0.177,0.751
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. No, listen, certainly, we hope not. I mean, at some -- these things, at some point, has to become just part of what we do as we rightsize the employee base. I mentioned on the last quarter call that we were taking a step back and really thinking about how the company was organized. I talked about the spans and the layers and the managers that have very few direct reports. That was a very specific initiative that we looked at across the entire company. I think what we would hope is, as we go forward, it becomes more ordinary course as managers manage based upon attrition and things like that, and hopefully, these things do go away.",neutral,0.0505,0.0729,0.8766
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.,neutral,0.0328,0.0259,0.9413
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"First question, some of the investments that you have been making and both your comments just on the focus on organic growth. Just wanted to get an update on maybe where you're seeing some of the earlier traction and what we should be focused on as we move through '19 and '20 to see some of the kind of the realizations.",neutral,0.0731,0.0188,0.9081
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. Why don't I start, and then Mike will comment along the way. I guess, listen, as you said, we've talked about the fact that given the nature of what our business is, it does take time. Having said that, there are some businesses that are further along and we see a clear path towards increasing the rate of revenue growth. Others is still evolving. 
Let me start with Pershing as an example. In the world in which Pershing operates, we've talked about the opportunity to expand our offerings and grow in the RIA categorically. Historically, we've been very, very strong in the broker-dealer category. So that's still a significant opportunity that we see. And just, I guess, more generically, there are more banks than broker-dealers that are looking at us for outsourcing. And I just -- when you just think about the increasing technology needs, the increasing complexity of what's required, other priorities they have, they're looking to us to figure out how to help them both wind up with a better product but also allow them to focus on what they can actually create value in. Today, we mentioned that in our remarks, that Pershing revenue declined 2% year-over-year even though it was flat year-to-year. Big portion of that is driven downward by these 2 clients that we've mentioned. Excluding that, we were up 4%. And I think the most important thing beyond that, which we've mentioned, is we have a very significant pipeline of signed business within Pershing where we're actually spending the money today to onboard those clients. As I mentioned in my remarks, that will start to happen in the second quarter of '19 and into 2020. But the pipeline as we see it -- I asked the question and it's hard to get the exact answer because of the size of the pipeline. But it's as big, if not -- it's bigger than any pipeline we've had in at least 5 years and probably more than that. And the wins and the opportunities are in the U.S., and then they're in Europe as well. And in Europe specifically, we see continued opportunities as the Wealth Management market here develops. So it's a lot on Pershing, but we feel really good about it because of what we actually see in the pipeline even though we've got to wait a little bit to see it in the revenue line. But longer term, Pershing is a -- it's a hugely important platform for us to participate in the growth in Wealth Management in the U.S. and in Europe. 
In addition to that, our own Wealth Management business, I've spoken about. This one's early on. Catherine Keating just joined us in the third quarter. She's working on developing exactly what the plans are, and she's starting to move towards implementation of what those are. It's product. It's banking infrastructure. It's sales products. It's incentives. And so that's not something we would expect to see in the next couple of quarters. But just given what we know we've done there, we've -- as I said, we've been a consistent performer, but we have more and should be able to grow faster than we're growing. 
Mike, maybe you want to talk a little about Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management.",neutral,0.4141,0.0196,0.5664
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, Mike. Maybe I'll start with clearance and collateral first. So when you look at that business, obviously, one of the big drivers of it is the business we're bringing in from the other competitor around the government clearing business. And when you look at the tri-party balance growth of 22%, about 2/3 of it's from those clients coming in from JPMorgan. About 1/3 of it is actually other new activity happening, both new clients and activity from our existing clients. And you're seeing good traction in products like our margin segregation product, where market participants now need to hold segregated margin balances with providers like us. And that was a business that was 0 just a couple of years ago. And we're seeing good traction, and that's contributing to sort of the growth in the collateral balances you see there. And there's a whole set of another initiatives that sort of underlies that business. And as we sort of bring in these government clearing clients, I think they're finding that our capabilities are a bit differentiated in the collateral space than what they saw. And are -- the conversations are happening -- are getting better and better and sort of happening real time here, and more people are interested in our collateral optimization service and the whole series of things that we've been trying to do there. 
On Treasury Services, again, this is another business where we brought in a new CEO just in the summer. And what Paul Camp has been working on is helping reposition sort of the way people think about us. Historically, we've positioned ourselves as more of a receivables bank, i.e., like we'll collect your payments, a collections bank versus a payments bank. And when you start focusing more on the payments piece, that's what brings liquidity balances and a broader set of dialogue that we can have with these clients. So we've changed our -- we've changed the leadership and focus of our sales team. We've changed the incentives. We have underneath it -- you can't see it from the disclosures, but underneath that, the Treasury Services deposits are growing just over 10% just from the third quarter. So when you look at third quarter to fourth quarter, they're up about 10%. And so you're seeing sort of the traction real time. And if I just use sort of one example, I'm not going to give you the client name, but when you look at -- there's an international development bank that we've been working with for a number of years in a very small way with Treasury Services. We have a strong relationship across the company with them, and we've been working to improve a couple -- very minor changes to some products that we have that opens up a wallet of billions of dollars of deposit balances that we have -- we're mandated on now and are sort of in the process of coming through. So you're seeing good traction in really all of these businesses that I think builds up over time to show sort of that organic growth story. 
I don't know, Charlie, you want to talk about Asset Servicing?",neutral,0.1414,0.0263,0.8323
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. Maybe I'll just -- I know this is a long answer, but obviously, this is extraordinarily important. Asset Servicing, hugely important part of the business. We -- our belief is we have real differentiation here. We have a data platform. We are willing to work openly with front-end providers, and we're working towards more tight integration to the benefit of our clients. And we're continuing to improve the infrastructure and the quality of what we do, which isn't a sexy thing to talk about, but in what we do, it really does matter. And so this is a -- this is more of a long-term build because of the nature of what these relationships are, how long the sales cycle is. But there's progress in what we're doing. This quarter, we brought in $100 billion of fund administration from just one client specifically, $400 billion of new custody, ETFs and mutual funds from a provider. So we have plenty of examples of places they're winning, but this will be a slower build because -- from where we're starting from, from what we've seen in Pershing and some of these other businesses. So why don't I stop there.",neutral,0.3065,0.0139,0.6796
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Okay. And then, Mike, just a quick one on capital. Just given the decline in the ratios with the buybacks and then what you mentioned on the balance sheet, how should we be thinking about managing that going forward just through the regulatory process and then just some of the opportunities that you're seeing?",neutral,0.0986,0.0437,0.8577
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I mean, obviously, Mike, between now and the second quarter of 2019, our remaining buybacks are already sort of defined based on what got approved in CCAR last year. So that should be pretty easy to sort of think about for the first half of the year. And as we look to CCAR 2018 -- or 2019, sorry, a lot of the work that we put into getting the incremental $800 million -- $830 million approved sort of flows right into sort of the modeling that we'll do as part of that process. That process kicks off sort of as we speak. And so over the next couple of weeks, I think we'll all have a better sense of sort of the inputs that go into that.",neutral,0.0716,0.0242,0.9042
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0346,0.0302,0.9352
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Maybe just a follow-on on the organic growth. Thanks, you guys, you covered a lot of that. A couple of additional questions. In terms of the market conditions, obviously, they're challenging right now, but how would you expect volatility to help your overall revenue, including on the organic growth side? If we have a situation in 2019 where we have choppy markets, maybe flat but much more volatile, can you talk about the potential benefit for both the collateral management business that you referred to, Mike, and FX and other trading? And then also, just quickly on the lag between expenses on the onboarding for Pershing versus clocking that revenue in.",neutral,0.165,0.0253,0.8097
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I mean, look, the expenses, as we -- I'll start the last piece first. So in Pershing, as we said, most of the expenses that we're incurring to onboard that business are being spent as we speak. And so the profile of the Pershing expense base is an expected change substantially in 2019. And as Charlie mentioned, that revenue will start to kick in, in the second half of '19 and more substantially in the first part of 2020, so you'll sort of see it come in that trajectory. 
As you sort of think about volatility, for us and so -- if I sort of tick through each of the businesses just to give you a sense of where we see it. So in Pershing, the -- we do see increased transaction volumes at times during periods of volatility. Having said that, much of the accounts that -- sort of that are underpinned. Our book of business there are managed accounts. So they're not -- we're not in a -- we're not necessarily supporting sort of retail -- self-directed retail brokerage-type clients. And so you won't necessarily see the peaks and valleys of transaction activity as sort of volatility spikes up and down, but you will see that sort of positively impacted. And as you look back over the last few months, transaction volumes were up a little, but they weren't outsized in sort of any way in that business. 
And then in Asset Servicing is where you'll -- you may see some of it as well. And so that -- we give you disclosures around our foreign exchange revenue. So obviously, if the volatility picks up in that -- in foreign exchange, you'll see that come through the revenue line. And then the volumes that we see will be dependent upon underlying client activity. And then in the core Asset Servicing business, think of the -- that revenue as -- probably about 1/3 of it is sort of transaction-driven revenue. And so that piece of it will move up and down based on what you see in the market. But keep in mind that, as I said in my remarks, about 1/3 of our assets under custody are equities. So just because you see big spikes and valleys in sort of the equity markets and volatility there, it doesn't necessarily mean that's going to translate into huge, huge upticks in sort of transaction-related revenue.",neutral,0.0817,0.0712,0.8471
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"And this is Charlie. Just I want to add one quick thing, which is and all that's very -- that's kind of what should drive some of these stats more mathematically. But to state the obvious, which is the reasons behind the volatility really matter to us. There's good volatility and there's less good volatility. What we've seen this quarter is the bad kind of volatility, which drives assets away from the businesses that we benefit from. And so the why will really matter to us as we look out over the next year.",neutral,0.0554,0.1467,0.7978
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Right. That makes sense. Maybe just a follow-on on the expenses. Charlie, if you can talk a little bit about -- a little bit more about the nature of some of the investments that are now in the run rate. Maybe just highlight a couple -- 2 or 3 of the most major ones. And then just from that, your discussion of the expense rate, expense base not significantly going up, is that an assumption on the markets remaining flat and say the set on hold or the markets improving? And then maybe just which management layer or areas were most restructured in terms of the businesses?",neutral,0.0565,0.0369,0.9065
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"So let me try and remember all 3, and I'll do them backwards. On the third one, it was across the entire company. As I said before, we really looked at spans, layers and the series of things like that across the entire entity, from the staff areas to Investment Services to our Investment Management businesses. And so I think it's very consistent. In addition, ongoing efficiencies through our operations areas on top of that are things that we've seen and then just tactically, some spots in different places. But overall, I would say it was pretty consistent. 
On the second question about expenses relative to the environment, I would characterize it as we're thinking about what the right level for us to invest in. And so I think with a cautious eye towards next year, that's where we plan for. To the extent that the environment gets even worse, we always have levers we could pull if we thought things were going to really get bad and actually stay there for a period of time. And maybe spend a little bit more if all of a sudden the world changed very dramatically. But I don't want to overstate either of those 2 cases up or down. I think where we're planning for is where we feel the right level of spend for us is within a reasonable range of outcomes for next year. And I'm sorry, the first -- ask the first one again.",neutral,0.0982,0.0424,0.8594
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"The first one was just -- yes, the first one was just maybe a couple of examples of the investments that you made most recently, in which areas -- technology investments, I'm sorry.",neutral,0.0482,0.044,0.9078
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Sure. So first of all, Mike's referenced and I referenced the work that's ongoing in Pershing to onboard these clients. A lot of the work to bring on these clients isn't just bringing -- I mean, it takes a long time because you have to build a set of capabilities, and you build the set of capabilities that you can then scale and provide to others. So there's a significant amount of technology work that has to go into bringing on those Pershing clients, and that's embedded in the overall spend numbers that we talk about. We've talked about in the Corporate Trust business how we continue to build out our technology platform for things other than just pure traditional products. That's embedded in this spend. So we think about Asset Servicing, we're highly focused on automation. We're highly focused on figuring out how to continue to build our data infrastructure. So I think those are just some examples.",neutral,0.0784,0.0203,0.9013

6,Brennan Hawken,,"I'm sorry, Charlie, were you in the middle of saying something?",negative,0.0295,0.625,0.3455
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. No, the only thing I just -- in my mind, I'm just thinking I think we -- one area that we haven't mentioned is our markets business. Since we think about where we would make investments, we've talked about this in the past. We've talked about the progress that we've made. You've seen it in the numbers. You see -- we've talked about some of the new products that we've offered, and a lot of what's happening there is really based upon technology spend.",neutral,0.066,0.0221,0.9119
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. Curious about deposit trends. So I think, Mike, you had commented that you guys see them as consistent quarter-to-date with what you saw in the fourth quarter. But deposit trends were a little mixed under the surface, and you excluded the wholesale or the CD prices from your deposit betas. So I'm curious. When you comment on deposits, are you talking about the total interest-bearing deposit balance that on average was $161.7 million? Or are you talking about the deposits excluding the CDs? And how should we think about that CD growth? It's really picked up. The growth in CDs has picked up pretty substantially here the last few quarters, how are you thinking that -- about that into next year?",neutral,0.1068,0.0655,0.8277
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. What I -- my remarks were in total, Brennan. Thanks for the question to clarify that. And the reason why I think you sort of need to look through the -- look through into sort of what's happening with your client deposits, obviously, wholesale funding is more index-based pricing for the most part. And so you really want to try to understand what's happening with your clients in those conversations. That's why we're trying to give you that color. I think as you sort of think about the wholesale funding, I don't see it moving in any substantial way from current levels.",neutral,0.0869,0.0369,0.8762
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. All right, great. And then to the second question on Issuer Services. You guys provided some color in the commentary on the fact that there were some elevated activities, Depositary Receipts, LatAm. Kind of curious about how sustainable you would see this activity level. Was this corporate action activity impacted by maybe the volatile markets that we saw in the quarter? Or it was also quite a quarter for M&A closing activity. Did that come into play into that line as well?",neutral,0.0708,0.04,0.8891
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. So M&A closing activity, no; volatility, a little bit, I guess, I would say. And I think -- relative to the question of sustainability, I guess the way to think about it is -- and we've talked about this, which is within Issuer Services, that's Corporate Trust and DR. Corporate Trust, we are seeing revenue growth. It's not huge but it is growing. And based on the actions that we've taken, hopefully, that will continue. It's -- that is deal by deal. And we feel better about our calling efforts. We feel better about the capabilities that we continue to build. So hopefully, that growth will continue. Within DRs, you know this and we've said this, is -- quarter by quarter can be very volatile, can be very, very seasonable. And if you look at our yearly performance from I think it's '17 to '18, while the quarters matter a lot, overall, when you look at the full year, relatively -- I don't remember exactly, but relatively flat. When we look at 2017 to 2018, same thing is true, albeit, within the fourth quarter, we had strong performance. And part of that, by the way, is driven by, in the fourth quarter of the prior year, we actually had a very weak DR quarter. So that's a long way of saying that as we look forward, we would think that the full year performance is sustainable, albeit it's going to be volatile quarter-to-quarter.",neutral,0.3464,0.0809,0.5727
6,Brennan Hawken,,"That's really fair. Just, I'm sorry, one follow-up on your comment on Corporate Trust. How much has the CLO trustee business helped in some of that Corporate Trust growth recently? Could you walk through a little bit about how sustainable you think that growth might be?",neutral,0.1618,0.012,0.8262
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Look, Brennan, underneath -- we don't disclose the components of Corporate Trust, as you know. But the CLO business has been an area of strength for us this year, where we have picked up market share. And so it has been a contributor to that underlying growth. And we've been talking consistently now for the last year or so where we've been making some investments in some of the underlying technology for -- to better support that business, and we're seeing the benefits of that come through, through some of the market share that we've been picking up this year. And so that has been a contributor.",positive,0.6346,0.0194,0.346

4,Alexander Blostein,,"First question just around the expense trends.

Charlie, I think you mentioned $100 million in tech spend this year. So did the investment pace change or some of that is just kind of slipping into next year?",neutral,0.0571,0.0594,0.8835

And given the trend we're seeing on a full year basis, we're -- we would still expect that to sort of tick up a little bit in 2019. I think in -- the DR revenue, I think, is the place where you've seen a little bit more volatility sort of year-to-year. So in '17 to '18, it was up a little. And our -- and given some of the things that Charlie talked about in terms of some timing of corporate actions that happened, the volatility that we saw that drives transactional volume in some of the different quarters and so as you said, as you -- as we sort of look to 2019, we think that 2018 numbers, plus or minus sort of a little, look like a good way to think about the full year story for next year.",neutral,0.2436,0.056,0.7004
