0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0387,0.0208,0.9405
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"I just wanted to understand as you're thinking through the operating levers that you delivered on this quarter, was there anything unusual in the expense line? I know you called out a couple of items. But then the follow-on is as you're thinking through 2Q and 3Q, can we expect the same kind of run rate that you delivered in 1Q?",neutral,0.0725,0.0388,0.8887
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"So other than the charges that we called out in the expense lines, I would say it was pretty much expenses as normal, so pretty much core run rate in our expenses.",neutral,0.0643,0.093,0.8427
34,Mark M. Bette,,"We did have a higher retirement-eligible impact and compensation of $30 million in the first quarter. But some of the other spend like business promo is sometimes a little bit lower in the first quarter too, but all in all pretty clean.",positive,0.3899,0.2993,0.3108
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. And we have the compensation expense in every first quarter which you can see flow through. But the rest of the other line items, I think, were pretty much as reported.",neutral,0.0779,0.3354,0.5868
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"I know you don't give guidance specifically, I'm not asking for that. I'm just wondering, the run rate that you're seeing in 1Q, do you think that kind of pace is something you can continue with? Or is there any kind of investment spend that you'd be ramping up on the back of this for 1Q?",neutral,0.0626,0.0249,0.9125
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Well, we continue to focus on our Value for Spend initiatives and to try to drive our expense base as hard as we can. But we also are growing, as you could see. And when you strip out the impacts of markets, it was pretty good underlying growth again in the quarter. So there is some expense that comes with supporting that growth. But I'd say in general, we think that the trajectory you saw here is something that we're going to -- is a decent run rate and that we're going to continue to try to improve it with our Value for Spend initiatives. But I think it's a pretty good run rate.",positive,0.888,0.0151,0.0968
0,Operator,,Our next question will be from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0339,0.0279,0.9382
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So I know you obviously don't give -- I know you guys don't give guidance obviously, but I was hoping we can talk through some of the NIR dynamics as a jumping off point from here. So I guess, one, noninterest-bearing deposits down a little bit over $1 billion. I think as you talked about in the past, you thought that kind of that excess number was sort of in that $1 billion range. So should we be thinking of that being sort of done? Or do you guys think there's more to go? And broadly speaking, is there anything you guys can do from a kind of firm, specific, idiosyncratic perspective to protect the level of NIR from here? Or is this pretty much kind of peak NIR for you guys?",neutral,0.0591,0.1514,0.7895
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"So let me walk through without providing guidance the way we're thinking about it. The first, Alex, is the volume of the balance sheet. And the thing we feel we can control most on the volume is through the continued organic growth in our custody business, primarily our AUC, which produces that growth in the balance sheet. And we've had pretty good results there, and we think if we can continue to do that, that the balance sheet should continue to grow with that inherent growth that we talk about in our custody business. As it relates to noninterest-bearing deposits that you talked about in this quarter and we talked in the past about that pool of a couple billion, I think, we've used is that of that runoff in noninterest-bearing deposits this quarter, half of it was from one client. So we still do have some sizable lumpy-type deposits that could be yield seeking, but we think it's inside the bucket that we told you in the past, the $1 billion to $2 billion of the noninterest-bearing. So we can control the volume. The second part of the forward look, if you will, without guidance is the mix. What we've seen in the mix of the balance sheet is we have seen interest-bearing deposits move from about 78% of the balance sheet to 80%. So that's a trend. I think that's a trend that we see in our industry amongst our competitors, and I think that's a market dynamic. So I'm not sure how much is controllable there, but we continue to look at that. And then the last piece that we still focus on is the spread or the yield that we can get from that, and I'll break that a little bit apart on the asset side. Look, we're still asset sensitive as a firm, and so if rates sort of flatten out from here. There is still the ability to have assets repriced higher for us. So that is a positive based on where we are. But then the liability side, the deposit beta and the pricing in the market is something we have to watch from a competitive dynamic. And I think we've been disciplined and we have a good process to watch that. And if we think it flattens out from here with no rate movements on the horizon, then there might still be the ability to grind up a little bit on the NIM over time. That's where we are. There's a lot of ifs in there, but we're -- if pricing and the competitive landscape holds stead, we still think we could see a grind up on the NIM.",neutral,0.1738,0.0236,0.8027
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question around just the core fees. I mean, looks like custody and admin fees in particular came in quite strong relative to a challenging exit as of the end of last year. I know you guys highlighted new business, so maybe expand on that a little bit. Was this a quarter of outsized new business wins that sort of drove fees where we ended up obviously being for the quarter? Without obviously naming clients, but maybe you can just help us kind of characterize where some of that business is coming from.",neutral,0.1382,0.0187,0.8431
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. We continue to see a strong pipeline across both of our businesses, both C&IS and Wealth then. Both produced, particularly versus first quarter of the previous year, strong performances. In fact, our C&IS business produced a much -- a really strong year-over-year comparison to the first quarter of last year on the new business front. And we continue to see a broad range of wins, both geographically, product line, client types, in both sides. In fact, on the Wealth side, our organic growth rate was at the higher end of the range as we've talked about as well in the first quarter. So pretty strong new business momentum. And then obviously the markets and others in the first quarter came back. And we have obviously some lag impacts, but we also have some month lag impacts, and so we saw the benefit of rising markets.",positive,0.9416,0.0175,0.041
0,Operator,,Our next question will be from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,neutral,0.0333,0.0304,0.9363
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Biff, maybe some of the expenses, given that you're at the $180 million, the $250 million, how should we be thinking about timing? I think you guys said through 2020, but are there any like initiatives in place that we should see, some steps along the way as we get into 2020?",neutral,0.0905,0.0186,0.8909
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So we've said the $250 million, we're continuing to push forward on that and making good progress as you can see. What I would say is that we're trying to build in the DNA and the culture here is that ongoing expense savings has to be a part of our regular routine. So while we've got a program defined that's $250 million, we also know that we have to embed culturally the ability to go in there and create economic savings from an expense standpoint on a longer-term basis than just 2020. We've got a program, we'll define it by 2020. But that discipline of taking some of the inflationary pressures out of our business through strong expense initiatives is embedding, and we can see it and it's becoming part of the culture. So we'll continue to track to the $250 million that we've told you about, but I think more importantly is embedding that discipline for forward-looking years beyond 2020.",neutral,0.1918,0.0141,0.7941
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Okay. And then just -- and the follow-up too on the last question in terms of the organic growth and even the fees, you tend to hold up or continue to hold up better than some of the peers out there. And maybe if you can just provide some color on some of the wins that you're seeing, maybe whether it's like asset mix, the client mix, just trying to get some color particularly on the C&IS side. And how much from like a competitive fee standpoint are you seeing versus maybe the mix, the product that continues to maybe hold up better than the industry?",neutral,0.2713,0.015,0.7137
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So let me pull it apart a little bit on the C&IS side, I would say. First, let's take some regional. We've seen strong growth in our Australia market where we've moved up near the top portion of the league tables. I was just talking with Pete Cherecwich before I came in. So we're near the top of the league charts there in our growth from a geographical perspective there. Luxembourg is another area with the UBS acquisition and other new business where we've seen outsized geographic growth that's organic, it's strong. In the client type, I'd say let me highlight 2. We continue to do very well with hedge funds. Our acquisition and hedge fund services has allowed us to grow. I think last year, we cited and continues to see wins in the hedge fund space. I think we had the largest hedge fund launch that was launched last year was a -- is a Northern Trust client, we had a press release on that. But we've also done very well in the foundation, in the endowment space is another example. And we've brought what I would say is a product and a capability there, a front office solution for what I'll say a large in-house pools of money which is commonly or typically done in a foundation or endowment. So that's 2 examples of a client type and a geography where I think we're seeing outsized growth. We've got more of those we can highlight, but we just have a strong performance right now in the growth. 
In terms of the second part of your question and the competitive nature of the pricing, look, this is a competitive business. I've been at the bank 34 years, it's been a competitive business for 34 years. I would say that we haven't seen it, at least in our client mix be outsized versus normal, which we would typically see somewhere a 1.5% to 2% type of fee pressures, which we assume in our organic growth rate. We had to overcome that. We've still seen that. And I think that in our client mix, that's what we've seen. I don't know that it's been higher than that right now, but it's also not lower and it seems pretty constant.",neutral,0.3086,0.0209,0.6705
0,Operator,,Our next question will be from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,neutral,0.035,0.0335,0.9315
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,So just wanted to unpack some of the remarks around the NII commentary and recognizing it's not a guidance. But I was hoping you could speak to your appetite to maybe extend the duration of the balance sheet given some concerns over the next move could be a Fed easing cycle and how we should think about against that backdrop maybe what the deposit trajectory could look like over the coming quarters if we are in a flat rate environment.,neutral,0.2011,0.0202,0.7787
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Well, what we say typically here is that we have a process where we go through and look at our own internal projections for interest rates and then we make decisions of how to position the balance sheet. I think it's fair to say that in the previous quarters, we've had some of the interest rate projections that I think are now being held more widely, and we have extended the duration in particularly the long-term portion of our securities portfolio. So we have that thought process and we do take actions when we see that. So that provides some protection against that down rate scenario. What I would also say is that if it behaves as normal, the deposit betas on a down rate cycle are typically pretty fast and pretty high. And we would anticipate that being the case here, too. So depending on just how that rate curve move happens and shifts, we could protect some of that spread and margin in a down rate scenario, plus with some of the actions we've taken on our asset sensitivity by adding the duration. So we have contemplated that, and I think we've got a lot of views from our investment management firm and our own chief economists that have views on the rate trajectory. So we take those all in and then make decisions on the overall ALCO, asset liability policy.",neutral,0.088,0.0288,0.8832
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"No, it's very helpful color. And just switching gears to the capital side. You guys continue to run with best-in-class capital ratios. I know you try to avoid deviating from some of your peers and try to manage to similar capital targets through the cycle. Just given some commentary from some of your trust bank peers about increased confidence, given some upcoming changes to leverage ratio as well as what appears to be maybe a more benign task than the -- in the coming exam, how you are thinking about your capital ask and whether you have increased confidence in your ability to maybe raise your payout target a bit.",positive,0.8144,0.0132,0.1723
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So we're pleased to enter this cycle that we just submitted here in April from a position of real strength as you could see from our ratio and the flexibility that, that gives us entering that period of time. The SLR was not a binding constraint for us. So that changed in definition. While we will take regulatory definitions that end up easing the ratio for us in that case, it wasn't a binding constraint, so I pull back on that. What I would say is in the quarter, I think we had a payout ratio of 119% in the quarter that we cited. So I think in the environment we're in, we don't feel constrained with what we want to ask other than our own constraints, which are do we have enough capital to support the growth we foresee in the business? Do we have enough capital to withstand our own idiosyncratic stresses? Do we have enough capital to support our clients' needs and wants? And I think the answer to that with where we are currently positioned is a pretty strong yes with a 13% CET1. So again, we like the flexibility that gives us going into the review by our regulators.",neutral,0.2354,0.0189,0.7458
0,Operator,,Next question will be from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0249,0.0524,0.9226
6,Brennan Hawken,,"So the C&IS fee rate was -- saw a bit of a bounce here this quarter. And I know this is an imperfect way to model your servicing revenues, but it's the best we've got. So could you maybe help us -- I know that you flagged new business wins this quarter, and so I'm guessing that contributed to some of that servicing fee rate improvement. Is that right? And then were there other factors? Can you just help us sort of level set given that this is the way most of us model your servicing revs and how to think about that line from here?",neutral,0.2977,0.0258,0.6764
34,Mark M. Bette,,"It's Mark. I would say as we look at the asset servicing fees on a sequential basis, there was certainly the market drag mainly from both month lag and quarter lag. We're probably looking at about a 2% to 2.5% drag from markets, and then currencies were actually modestly better but very little. So really, the new business that we saw on the fee side would have been kind of offsetting that because the fees were basically flat during the quarter. So pretty strong on the new business side. I mean, it does become a function of the business that we're adding. I would say that we are going to look at the mix of business that we're adding these days. We probably are -- from a fee [bps] rate perspective, that new business is probably coming on at a higher level than what a traditional custody would be, for instance. And some of the moves that we've seen -- large moves on a year-over-year basis where there has been -- we talked about one transition last quarter would have been at a lower [bps] rate than what rating segment we're bringing on new global fund servicing business. So it kind of comes back to the mix of what's coming on and then kind of how the point in time assets look versus the fees that you kind of earn kind of as you go through the quarter.",neutral,0.1242,0.0559,0.8198
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Yes. Okay. That makes a lot of sense, Mark. And then next one is on NII and some of the comments that you've made here so far. So -- and this is sort of a cleanup, so I'm kind of dumping a couple of cleanups in here into one. When we think about -- I think you said that there was one large outflow with the noninterest-bearing that you still think nonoperating is 1 to 2. So was some of the outflow from the nonoperating? And just so we can kind of think about that. Or was this more competitive pressure? And then given the fact that you still think and NIM can grind higher and your deposits can grow, that seems to suggest that you guys feel pretty good about NII growth from 1Q as a starting point. Is that fair? Or do we need to be concerned about upward pressure on deposit costs?",neutral,0.1495,0.0707,0.7798
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Let me take the second question first on the upward pressure. That is a competitive dynamic. I think we feel that we have stayed abreast of the market and that we are -- we have competitive pricing in the institutional space today. But we have to observe the market. And I mean that, as you know, there's sort of very public -- our clients probably are aware of the market pricing from a relatively small number of competitors, and so that pricing is pretty transparent, particularly on the institutional side. So we'll remain competitive is all I can say. And if there's not upward pressure from others than I think on the deposit pricing there. And the first question was on the...",neutral,0.1017,0.0705,0.8278
34,Mark M. Bette,,"On the decline in noninterest-bearing. And on that, it -- I mean this was a situation where a client was seeking other yield enhancement on that money. But I would also add that of the decline, so call that half of a decline, there was also a decline that we saw. About 1/3 of the decline was not in U.S. dollar currency. It was actually in nonmajor currency around the world. So those were probably just more transactional frictions that those clients have kind of moving through the system, not necessarily an indicator of future trends because that wasn't part of some of the fee revs dollars looking for higher yields.",negative,0.039,0.7699,0.1911
0,Operator,,Next question will be from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0261,0.041,0.9329
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Great. Let me just go back to the organic growth trends, so just especially in the custody and fund admin business. Looks like we should have a decent tailwind coming into the second quarter both on a markets basis. But also if you can just comment on the cadence of organic growth. It looked, like you said, very strong if that came in during the quarter, so we also have a little bit of a fee tailwind from that. And then to add onto that, maybe if you can talk about your front to back office integration, the open architecture approach. I know it's counter to State Street. I think you have a partnership with Bloomberg. How -- I guess how new is that effort? And should we expect that to be something that can enhance your organic growth over time?",neutral,0.225,0.0116,0.7634
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Sure. Let me do the organic growth part first. I must split the businesses apart here if I could real quick. Yes, we saw -- we've talked as a firm of the range that we're comfortable with from an organic growth perspective. In any given quarter, we can be in that range, slightly lower, slightly higher. But then our businesses themselves can have different trajectories as well. Our Wealth business, as I said actually, I think, saw organic trajectory at a higher end of its historical range. But that's lower than what we talked to you about target -- it's a slightly lower organic growth business. And our C&IS business, if you exclude securities lending, which is heavily capital markets influenced, also was in the range that we've talked about for that business from an organic growth standpoint. It's hard to ignore the securities lending and asset management businesses, but when -- if you peel those out, we were in the organic kind of growth rate from a pure asset servicing business that we've seen. So that was a strength there. In terms of the value chain or the -- our positioning, what I would say is we don't believe we have to own every piece of the value chain. An example is an OMS, an order management system. It's -- I think it's our goal is to allow our clients to access our technology and allow them to communicate and process their trades in an efficient manner. It's a competitive landscape in the OMS space, and there's some very good providers out there. So we think being able to partner and integrate with those vendors is very important. We do have a relationship as we highlighted in our press release at the end of March with Bloomberg where we're doing just that. But that's an example of a very important vendor in the space that we've struck up a strategic partnership with and can bring that to bear. So I would say at the end of the day, we believe very much that we don't have to bring every piece of that component of the value chain and own it all the way through, that we can partner with some best-in-class providers in different spaces and make it work.",neutral,0.1449,0.0198,0.8353
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"No, that's great color. And then just maybe just one on expense growth. Looking at the year-over-year basis, if I'm measuring this right, looks like about 3%, 3.5%, which would be tracking below your organic -- I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but maybe slightly below your organic growth rate on a year-over-year basis. So is that mostly due to Value for Spend program coming through? Because I know you've tried to match that expense growth. I know it can't be on -- every quarter but would generally sound like you're tracking very well against that goal.",neutral,0.2033,0.1245,0.6722

34,Mark M. Bette,,About 4.5%.,neutral,0.0416,0.0329,0.9256
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So call it 4.5% type of a growth rate, which is in the range of where we've talked about organic fee growth rate. So I think they're reasonably well aligned. We'd like to get that organic growth rate and the expenses down a little lower, so we created leverage to what we've talked about. But in full transparency, the reported number had some currency benefit in it. Obviously, fees have some currency drag equal and offsetting to that, but we would have probably pinned it somewhere in the 4.5% type range from the quarter on an organic expense growth rate.",neutral,0.1668,0.1691,0.6641

37,James Francis Mitchell,,Maybe just a follow-up on Wealth Management. You noted that you're at the high end of the organic growth range. I know you've been investing there to try to accelerate organic growth. Is that sort of early evidence that you're getting success? And maybe just talk a little bit more broadly about what you're doing to drive better organic growth there and what you think the traction is so far.,neutral,0.2472,0.0115,0.7413
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So I would -- I'd pick a couple of components to that. One, I think the technology that underpins that, the Goals Powered Solutions and the approach to the holistic advice, so the goals-driven Wealth Management, has really resonated with our clients. We've really seen that be a differentiator in the market and we've been told that consistently by our clients and other setters of influence that influence the wealthy individuals that we have a differentiated technology to bring to bear for people. So I think that's been really successful. And the other thing I would say is we've done a good job of attracting clients in what I will call our virtual markets. As you know, we've got physical offices and about 60 locations in most of the wealth centers around the country. But there are other cities where we don't have necessarily physical presence. And we've been able to create I'll call a virtual team type environment and really penetrate some -- I don't want to say secondary cities, but cities that aren't in the major metropolitan wealth centers but still have significant wealth without having to put physical footprints in. It's been a really successful strategy. That's 2 examples of really strong growth that are, I think, pushing us up towards a pretty significant organic growth rate relative to the industry in Wealth Management.",positive,0.5877,0.0142,0.3982
37,James Francis Mitchell,,"Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one other question on deposit betas. It seemed like this quarter, at least on an aggregate level, your deposit beta was -- has actually slowed versus the last 3 or 4 quarters. I think some of your peers are mentioning accelerating deposit betas and high competition. So just trying to get a sense of maybe the difference that you're seeing. Are you seeing that competitive pressure on deposit rates? It doesn't look like it. Just maybe talk to the deposit beta this quarter and where you think if anything's changed going into 2Q.",negative,0.0431,0.7776,0.1793
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. I caution you to look at 1 quarter's beta. We could be catching up, slowing down from previous moves that we've made. I think if you go back and look at our beta across the cycle, you would start with the rate cycles and hikes and go back to 2016 if you want to go back, our beta will look much more like you would expect across a longer horizon. So I think it's a little bit dangerous to only look at it from 1 quarter because we -- like I said, we could have slowed because we were comfortable with our positioning in a quarter or we could

Biff, you mentioned earlier that the second quarter won't have the same stock-based compensation that the year-ago quarter had.

34,Mark M. Bette,,"Ken, it's Mark. We are having some audio difficulties on our end. Hopefully, what we're saying is coming through. But yes, you're right. So the last couple of years, you'll remember there was an extra expense that came through in the second quarter from the retirement-eligible grants. Last year, there was $11 million in the second quarter. So we had $32 million in the first, $11 million in the second a year ago. This year, we had $30 million in the first, but there will not be further retirement-eligible stock expense that would impact the second quarter because of the changes in the service requirements around the performance shares. So $11 million during the second quarter of last year, but this year we would not have that.",neutral,0.0975,0.1719,0.7306
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Got it. That's a nice year-over-year starting point helper. And then second one on the deposits. Biff, you mentioned that the customer-related deposits should be growing with the growth of the business. But obviously, the balance sheet has been net shrinking because again of that removal of liquidity and -- how has the core deposits been growing underneath the surface? And how can you help us like understand the inflows versus outflows in terms of trying to guess and estimate when that total earning asset base starts to bottom and turn the corner upwards?",neutral,0.1198,0.3812,0.4991
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Yes. Yes. Thanks. So the answer is at the core -- and it's hard to see in any of the financials we put out there, but I would say it's a general statement. At the core, we have seen that core operating balance has sort flattened out. It's hard to see, like you said, all the liquidity moving on and off the balance sheet, so it can be difficult to see. The other thing I would say too is when we say that the new business that we win comes with balances, some of the new business wins we've been having are administration in nature and they don't always come with balances. So the mix of business we win matters, too. Over time, we tend to win a broad-based mix of business, some which come with custody balances, some which come with administration. I would say we had more wins in the -- large wins in the administrative side that may or may not come with balances. It's one of the reasons you may see our AUC and AUC/A a little bit flatter but revenue still going up and fees going up because the mix of that business is different [indiscernible] with the balances. So you got the dynamic of the win mix [ matters ] and then you've got the dynamic of the underlying balance sheet because that's what I would call the liquidity flows or the excess balances moving around.

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,Just a couple of questions here. On the -- you had mentioned you're taking a while a bit more duration in the securities portfolio. Can you actually give what the securities duration is now and still how much is tied direct repricing on a [indiscernible] basis?,neutral,0.0375,0.0438,0.9188
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"So the duration of the portfolio has historically been closer to 1. And it moved up by 30% or something like that. The long end of the securities portfolio is longer than that. But [indiscernible] of the portfolio has moved up by that 30-or-so percent. And the second part of your question broke up, I apologize. Can you repeat?",neutral,0.2338,0.1004,0.6657
34,Mark M. Bette,,I think it may have been the exposure to the 30-day rates within the [indiscernible]?,neutral,0.0312,0.3625,0.6064
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Yes, how much reprices in the next 30?",neutral,0.0465,0.0258,0.9277
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Yes. So on the securities side, the short end of the -- I should say, if you split the securities portfolio in half, a little bit more than half is the shorter portfolio. And there, we would say a lot of that would be driven by the 1-month, 3-month type of LIBOR moves with a little bit more weighted toward the 1-month side. So it does -- that part of the securities does reprice pretty quickly. And when you get to the longer portfolio, obviously, not all that is going to roll over in 1 quarter or even 1 year. That's kind of over the course of -- if for instance, if you're sitting with, on average, 2 years securities and it was a nice even book, in theory that means that 1/8 of it would roll through every quarter. That's not to say where we're at, but that's just an example of what you would have if you were staying with a 2-year book when you look at the longer portfolio. Does that help? We're having some audio problems here.",neutral,0.0532,0.095,0.8518
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"It does. And then just a second quick follow-up on the deposit runoff. I think in the past, you said that you've been able to capture as much as 2/3 of those deposits. Is that still -- is it now that's still true? Or is it a lot of that deposit runoff just running away from you in total?",neutral,0.0533,0.2254,0.7213
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"I think we've said we've captured about half of it, can move into a money fund and then half [indiscernible] to some other vehicle and [indiscernible] investment vehicle somewhere else or would lead. I don't know that I know if that's changed dramatically from what we've seen. So I think it is still -- we've seen growth in our cash funds, as you can see, particularly on the institutional side when we saw growth in our cash funds. So there's clearly [indiscernible] in the cash funds from the balance sheet, and we continue to look at an array of the opportunities for [indiscernible] balance sheet [indiscernible] cash funds. So we've been able to capture a meaningful portion through the company.",positive,0.5025,0.0203,0.4772
