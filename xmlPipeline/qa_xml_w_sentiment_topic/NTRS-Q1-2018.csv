0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0486,0.018,0.9334
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Maybe just to start off with FX trading, obviously, another strong result. Can you talk about the portion that you think is due from the FX swap activity in the treasury business? And it looks like even adjusting for currency volatility we're -- in the last 2 quarters now, we're seeing a big step up in that run rate just to sort of to think about that going forward.",positive,0.9205,0.0138,0.0657
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. Thanks, Brian. So we had really solid growth both sequentially and year-over-year in foreign exchange, as you highlighted, and that was really driven by 2 key factors. The first was that in our core trading, if you will, our core trading business, volumes were higher and we did see some higher volatility. And so that produced approximately $63 million to $64 million of the FX volume you see, which is above our traditional run rate there. The remainder, approximately $15 million, is from that treasury swap activity that we called out. And if I could, I'd like to give a little bit of an explanation on that. As a part of our normal balance sheet management, we manage our currency and put it in the most effective currency. We have been able to, because of a demand for dollars from certain institutions, take dollars from our fed balances, swap them into sterling and euro and place them with the ECB or the Bank of England. So when we've done that, the resulting benefit from the currency swap flows through the FX line. As you would understand, we gave up some net interest income to get that. So the $15 million improvement you have seen in the FX line that's attributable to treasury trades was -- there was about $10 million of net interest income give up to do that, but that's still a good economic trade for our shareholders, if you think about that. And right now, that's because of the widening we've seen in that swap trade because of the demand for dollars. So it's hard to project where that trade in that spread will go, but we've taken the right currency decisions and the right balance sheet decisions in the first quarter this year, and even a bit of the tail end of 2017. So about $63 million to $64 million was core FX and $15 million was driven by the treasury swaps. You'll be able to see that in the 10-Q as well that shows up under the treasury trading line in the segment reporting.",neutral,0.3055,0.0352,0.6593
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Great. That's fantastic color. And then maybe just follow-up on expenses. Obviously, a good -- a very good expense control quarter and you've achieved a little over 25% of the $250 million program so far on a run rate basis. So if you could just talk about the trends going into 2Q and into the rest of this year. If 1Q was a sort of a high achievement for the year or do you see this continuing into the year. And then I think that if you just -- you did mention something about talking about reinvestment in other growth initiatives on some of that, if you can detail that as well?",neutral,0.2821,0.0152,0.7026
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Let me talk on the expense side around it. So our core expense growth rate that we highlighted for you at about 5.5%, we think that's what our core actually was in the quarter. If I look at any individual lines there, I would call out, perhaps, in the other operating expense line, there can be some seasonality, some lower seasonality in that because our business promotion tends to be a little lower in the first quarter and staff-related expenses, which generally are attributed to ex-pats, hypothetical tax or hypo tax, can also have some episodic nature in the first quarter and be a little bit lower. But the trend along the other expense lines is generally as you would have seen historically unfold. That's the only line item I would say is lower than maybe a traditional run rate. I think it's probably better to look at other operating expense over a year, over a calendar year, because we'll have the Northern Trust Open in the third quarter and others. I'd look at that expense line on over a year and it could have a little seasonality. The other line items, obviously, there's equity compensation in the first quarter that is traditionally larger than it would be in subsequent quarters. So you, I'm sure, can adjust for that in your models as you go forward. And I'm not sure where we talked about investments, I'm not sure where we said that, but we continue to reinvest in our business where the opportunity is there, but we continue to execute on value for spend. As you saw the highlights in this quarter, that execution needs to continue throughout the year and that helps provide for that investment opportunities in the company.",neutral,0.1022,0.1654,0.7324
0,Operator,,"And moving on, we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.",neutral,0.0427,0.0166,0.9407
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So first question is around NIR and some of the funding dynamics we saw from you guys in the quarter. I guess 2 questions there. First, on the balance sheet side itself, so continued nice growth in average earning assets up 2-ish percent, I think, quarter-over-quarter. How much of that is due to kind of new customer business versus some of the discretionary leveraging you've done in the past?",neutral,0.4209,0.0311,0.548
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. It's a bit of both. So we have continued to see the strong new business, but there was also some increased discretionary leverage so...",positive,0.9485,0.028,0.0235
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Yes. Alex, the discretionary leveraging was actually down about $1 billion sequentially. On a year-over-year basis though, it was about $3 billion last year and closer to $7 billion this year.",negative,0.0095,0.9544,0.0361
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,Yes.,neutral,0.1082,0.0226,0.8692
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got you. And then I guess on the -- yes, go ahead.",neutral,0.0738,0.0211,0.9051
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,No. I would say it's a bit of both.,neutral,0.0522,0.1205,0.8273
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got you. And I guess on -- more importantly on the funding side, so if we look at the deposit betas and just the level of noninterest-bearing deposits, so maybe we can unpack both of those. But I guess, on the deposit beta side, it looks like cost are up only 3 basis points sequentially which, again, is kind of nice to see given the fact that rates continue to move higher, so maybe help us unpack what's going on there. And then on the noninterest-bearing deposit side, again, it went up nicely. The balance went up nicely, sequentially, for the first time in a while, so maybe speak to kind of what drove that. How sustainable do you think that is? And do you guys think there might actually be an opportunity to reduce some of the short-term borrowings you had to put into place, given the fact that deposits seem to be holding up better? I know there's a bunch of stuff in there, but all kind of funding related.",positive,0.7917,0.0332,0.1751
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. Let me start on the -- yes, we'll go to the liability. But on the betas, I think it's probably easier to look at the betas over longer period than any one quarter because, Alex, we can have periods where it seems like our beta is lower than you may think, but we may have been ahead of the market in some periods and there's other periods where maybe there's catch up in any one given period. But if you look over time, it's probably a better measure. The second part of that I would say is we really do follow the markets, both for our retail deposits and for our institutional deposits. And particularly, on the institutional side, it's a competitive marketplace. We got great environment to look and see what our competitors are doing, and we try to match that in the marketplace or move with that in the marketplace and keep track of it. On the retail side or on the Wealth Management deposit side, we have seen some increased competition in that marketplace or some increased rate from some of the peer competitors that we would have in the wealth space. And we've got a process, a disciplined process to look at our rate environment and pass those betas on. So, so far, the betas are what you see in there and we'll probably continue to move in [indiscernible] step is where you anticipate market is going. In terms of the noninterest-bearing deposit, you're right, they had a slight increase in the quarter. A modest increase. I would be hesitant to tell you that I think that is the new flat level. We saw some monies come in that could be rate-sensitive in the quarter, but that's 3 quarters in a row that it's been around the $21 billion to $22 billion level. We track that very closely, particularly the piece of that, which is about 1/4 of that or $5 billion to $6 billion of that, that we would deem to be the most rate sensitive. The remainder of that is wealth deposits and other things that are traditionally supporting what I would say core operating businesses. But we continue to have regular dialogues with that sort of $ 5billion to see the sustainability of that and the long-term rate sensitivity of that. So far it's held up for 3 quarters.",neutral,0.2516,0.0332,0.7152
0,Operator,,"And moving on, we'll go to Brennan Hawken with UBS.",neutral,0.0527,0.013,0.9343
6,Brennan Hawken,,"So just wanted to circle back to -- I believe you highlighted in your commentary, Biff, about a balance sheet mix shift on the NIM front. And I know that you had talked a little bit about the FX swap, was that what you were referring to? Was there something else? Could you maybe provide a little bit of additional clarity on what was behind that and what was behind that comment?",neutral,0.0669,0.0439,0.8892
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Sure. So that is one piece of it. And as you've also seen, the loan portfolio as a portion of the balance sheet has gone down over time as our loan growth is flattened out or even gone slightly negative. So if you look at those 2 items, plus there's also some currency mix shift, some of that was caused by the swap as we moved out of dollars into other currencies. But the combination of those 2, essentially, was the mix shift that I was talking about in the earlier question.",negative,0.0238,0.841,0.1353
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. Got it. And then thinking about the loan book and the proportion, can you remind us and maybe update us in so far as how things have changed. How much of that book reprices in the beginning of the year? How should we think about the repricing of the loan book as rates continue to -- or assuming rates continue to rise as they are as a forward curve suggest and the potential for that to work its way through. Just in thinking about sort of the blocking and tackling of modeling that book for you guys.",neutral,0.0662,0.0226,0.9112
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So in terms of the seasonality component you asked first, it's really very modest. I think you're probably better off not thinking about it being that seasonal based on the current loan portfolio, as our portfolio has changed over time. I think, probably, your better indicator is to look at where the loan yields moved sequentially between December and March of this year, and you saw a pretty meaningful pickup from the spreads. As you might imagine, our funding for those loans is shorter in nature kind of overnight to 1 month kind of LIBOR and the asset spread has been able to move a little bit faster with some of the widening you've seen based on our funding level. So I think we -- I would focus more on what you saw sequentially here and think about that as a better indicator of the yield pickups across those loan instruments. The other thing I would say to remember is we have a portfolio where the residential real estate has been in decline now for some time, and it's being replaced by what I would say our week would call investment management accounts secured loans, secured by your portfolio. Those tend to have lower yields. They also have lower credit risk associated with them. So that part needs to be factored into as you think about pricing.",neutral,0.1202,0.2404,0.6395
0,Operator,,And next from Autonomous Research we'll go to Geoffrey Elliott.,neutral,0.0416,0.0224,0.936
9,Geoffrey Elliott,,"Thank you for giving that 5.5% figure for core expense growth. Can you help us think about organic revenue growth? Clearly, an important target for you to run with that in line with or above expense growth, but what do you think that is right now?",neutral,0.1058,0.0129,0.8813
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. We would -- in the quarter, we would say it was approximately 5%. And that -- in relation to that 5.5% core that I gave you, remember, in that 5.5% core there are some inflationary or inorganic factors, right. Our sub-custody fees are tied to -- expenses are tied to market levels and there are other factors in those expense bases that are -- so what we would say, our organic expense growth rate is probably a little lower than the 5.5% that I quoted you. But the 5.5% is a good core sort of expense growth rate from our view. And then whatever you want to adjust out of that from your own organic or inorganic. And then on the organic revenue side or fee side, on the organic fee side, let me be clear, we would say it was about 5% in the quarter.",neutral,0.0614,0.0862,0.8524
9,Geoffrey Elliott,,"And then on the target ROE range of 10% to 15%, clearly, this quarter you came ahead of the top end of that range. I mean, how do you think about that in an environment where the tax rate is lower? Or is it time to think about moving the 10% to 15% up?",neutral,0.1397,0.0597,0.8006
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. I think the change that's happened with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act has caused us to look at our target range, and we will go through that process and look at that. We also want to see that unfold for a bit though, right. We're 1 quarter in. We want to see how the markets react, it is 1 quarter. As you saw in this quarter, the benefit of that tax cut flowed largely through to our shareholders in this quarter. But I think we'd like to observe the behavior of the competitive landscape for some time, but we are taking all of those factors into play. I do believe this is the kind of secular change, much like when we all had to add capital coming out of the crisis when we revisited our ROE target. This is the type of secular change that causes that revisitation. But we'd like to have some observation of the marketplace to help inform that process.",neutral,0.0702,0.0255,0.9043
0,Operator,,And next we'll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,neutral,0.0397,0.0183,0.942
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Biff, on the capital front, you've mentioned the willingness to leverage the balance sheet a little bit more. And then, also, given that we got this notice of proposed rulemaking and that you're not a GSIB, can you talk about just how you think that might change your view of what's binding and how much excess capital you truly have to hold versus minimums and versus peers. Does it give you any flexibility upon first glance?",neutral,0.071,0.0323,0.8967
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"If I look at the NPR is it related to, first, was -- the CCAR when it came out? I would say that was largely as we expected. And it, basically, I think is what Governor Tarullo had largely highlighted before. And I would say from our standpoint, we're supportive of it. It does increase our flexibility as we think about it around our capital planning, but I don't know if that has a material financial impact to us at all in terms of how we run our business because we've been operating under the capital rules for a while. In terms of flexibility, as I think about leverage, in some of the commentary that's come out from the supplementary leverage ratio, we're not bound by that and that was really something I think that was more impactful to the GSIBs than it was for us. So if they changed Tier 1 leverage, that is currently our binding constraint. So you ask about our capital levels, we would be bound by Tier 1 leverage, although not terribly bound by that as you can see from our capital levels. And lastly, Ken, I would end by, we've just submitted our capital plan. We await the feedback that we will get in June, but we ended that from a position of strength. And as we think about the uses of our capital, we can either deploy it on the balance sheet and put it to work, or we can return it. And we've made a -- and ask to our regulator, and we'll see how that is opined on.",neutral,0.1395,0.0186,0.8419
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Understood. And to that last point, Biff, can you just kind of help us understand how you think about those 2 factors. The decision tree to use a little bit more leverage and get some NII versus the decision tree to put it into an extra vibe, an extra ask if you had extra flexibility.",neutral,0.1232,0.0155,0.8614
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. Sure. So if I -- the first thing we look at is if we're contemplating return, if you think about that, we've got a dividend range that we've been comfortable. If you look historically, we talked about in our dividend returns, and it's been somewhere in the 30% to 40% dividend payout ratio over time. Then we think about the rest of that return in the form of buyback. When we think about it in the form of buyback, we first look at to make sure we offset dilution. As you saw in this quarter, we did a little bit a larger amount of buyback, particularly because we've had shareholder dilution that we wanted to offset. But then the second part, I think, that gets to your question is as we look at the return to shareholders. And so if there are internal uses or external uses for that capital to drive a higher shareholder return than a buyback, that's something we contemplate as management do. If we think the buying of shares back is the maximum return, we do that. If we think not buying shares back and using it as leverage on the balance sheet as the maximum return, we do that. And we weigh all 3 of those and end up choosing the one that we think is the best return path for our shareholders.",neutral,0.0694,0.0285,0.9021
0,Operator,,"And moving on, we'll go to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISR.",neutral,0.0543,0.0128,0.9329
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"A quick one on just the -- the all-in yield on the securities book came down and government is moving up and everything else is moving down. It's a little counterintuitive as people think of higher rates and also how much of your business is floating. So maybe we can just get an update on [indiscernible] floating in the securities book, what's it flowed off of and just if we should expect it to move forward from here -- up from here, sorry.",negative,0.0343,0.7657,0.2
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So let me walk you through the securities portfolio because if it isn't intuitive, then it would have gone down. But it will be, I hope, more intuitive when you walk you through that. First of all, in the securities portfolio, about 16 basis points was premium amortization. So that in itself would have started to move the securities yield to where you want it. We also had about 5 basis points of drag from FTE in -- which is offset in the FTE line, but we had about 5 basis points of drag from that. And then we had about 5 basis points of drag from the mix shift that I talked about earlier. That was really then offset by about 20 basis points from rates and offset by day count because, obviously, we had fewer days, so that improved the securities yield. I hope that's better color because if you add all of that together, that securities yield very much moved the way you would have thought. In fact, it would have been one of the biggest moves we've seen in the securities yield, sequentially. It just was masked somewhat by the -- particularly, the premium amortization in the quarter. But I think that's a pretty good walk.",neutral,0.3275,0.121,0.5515
34,Mark M. Bette,,"And Glenn, as far as the mix, we would still look at it. If you look in the portfolio, roughly half and half, the shorter portfolio versus the longer, and the shorter would move with both 1 month and 3-month, with 1-month a little bit more weighted than the 3-month. And then for the longer portfolio, you're looking at 2-, 3-, 5-year type of maturities. Overall, kind of weighted slightly above 1 year for the whole portfolio. So hopefully, that helps.",neutral,0.1128,0.0248,0.8624
0,Operator,,"And moving on, we'll go to Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.",neutral,0.0459,0.0148,0.9392
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Biff, maybe just one follow-up on the asset yields and then the overall NIM. If I kind of put everything together and just think of like a starting point for 2Q, is it really just the premium amortization change? And I think you mentioned it might have been a $7 million new increase in the first quarter. So should we normalize for that or are there other components you mean that we should be normalizing to thinking about like a starting point for the second quarter?",neutral,0.0855,0.035,0.8795
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. I would say if you think about the NIM sequentially from fourth quarter to the first quarter, the things that impacted it that you could factor in is the NIM benefited by day count. So there could be some drag, if you will, because the day count will be higher in the second quarter, but that was about 1 basis point. Premium amortization was about 7 points of NIM drag in the quarter, and then you can subtract what you think is a normalized impact. That's the total impact, but I'll let you do that. And then there was some, from the FTE adjustment, about 2 bps of drag. And then there was about 5 basis points of that currency and mix shift that I talked about on the balance sheet, but rates themselves probably would have added about 12 bps. If you do all of that math and you go back, I think you can get to probably a NIM that's a better launch point. Mark, I don't know if you have anything you want to add.",neutral,0.0845,0.0664,0.8491
34,Mark M. Bette,,"No, I don't think so. But with -- and reiterating a point that Biff made about the FX trading line, which we had $15 million of benefit there from our treasury swap activity, that actually if that had not occurred, we estimate we would have about $10 million more of NIM or net interest income in the quarter. So that was part of that mix change that Biff highlighted sequentially.",neutral,0.0764,0.0395,0.8842

16,Vivek Juneja,,"A couple of quick questions. The $250 million cost cuts, Biff, can you give a little bit more color on that. What are we going to be getting this from timing? When should we start to -- we were expecting you'd start to give more granularity around this?",neutral,0.0743,0.0255,0.9002
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So as we said in our prepared remarks, in the quarter we had $14 million of savings, which on a run rate basis would be approximately $55 million. The categories that those savings would have come from were, in some cases, what we would call organizational alignment, that's things like aligning our staff to the right locations, aligning our staff from eliminating redundancy, et cetera. So those programs are underway, and they're producing the savings we see. But we also have savings in areas like procurement, where we negotiated different contract arrangement with a variety of vendors. That also provided some of that $14 million in savings in quarter. And then we are continuing to get what I would call process optimization opportunities where we are utilizing robotics and other artificial intelligence opportunities on things like document ingestion, et cetera. All of those are starting to contribute to that. And we have a portfolio of opportunities that, on a regular basis, we will update you with how they help drive those savings. As we said, I think, consistently, we anticipate that that savings will be roughly evenly distributed across the 3 years. And as you can see, we're off to a pretty good start with $55 million in sort of the first quarter this year.",positive,0.5267,0.0159,0.4573
16,Vivek Juneja,,"Okay. So when you're saying evenly distributed over 3 years, let me just clarify, the $250 million so of that, let's say, when I round the number, $80-ish million we should see this year, so it's $14 million -- it's not taking that $55 million annualized, it's actually $14 million plus whatever you get additional in the next quarter and the following 3 quarters, and all of that adding up to $80 million? Or are you talking about some kind of annualized run rate?",neutral,0.0436,0.0572,0.8993
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Vivek, this is Mark. I think the way you're thinking about it would probably be the right way where you would add up the quarters and the impacts. Again, it's still early in this. It's not going to be a smooth straight line and to the extent that we get more visibility around that as we go, we'll update you. But we do think, at this point, we're looking at a -- that's probably the best way, the way you outlined it, for now, is the best way to think about it.",neutral,0.0997,0.0198,0.8805

16,Vivek Juneja,,"Well, my point is that the $14 million or $15 million, whatever you want to use, the annualized is $55 million already. So if you were to, let's say -- so you've got $25 million left, if you were to achieve a little more in the second quarter, you could be done. So is it really just 1/3 each year or is that not much this year and therefore, the rest there's some -- I'm trying to understand, is there like something going on that pushes some of the savings to year 2 or the interpretation should be more that even if you just simply add $5 million or so per quarter incremental, you could actually be a -- we may be running a little bit ahead of the 1/3.",neutral,0.0778,0.0679,0.8543

18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,Just following up on the last question. So your pretax margin of 33% is the highest in several years. Do you expect the pretax margin to stay at that level or is there more investment spending that we should expect going forward?,positive,0.5561,0.0134,0.4305
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"We're going to continue to try to drive the profitability of the firm in all of the key metrics. If we continue, we think to drive that expense to fee ratio even harder that we think we can improve that pretax margin over time. But -- and we think our current plans, we have -- we can both execute on value for spend and have investment opportunities inside of our business. So we do think there is still some opportunities to improve both. We moved meaningfully this quarter, as you saw in that expense to fees, but we do think there is opportunities. As you saw in our wealth business, it actually improved its margin meaningfully in the quarter as did our C&IS business. So yes, we do. We think there's opportunities.",positive,0.9439,0.0113,0.0448
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"And is the expense-to-fee ratio still the right measure as opposed to expenses to total revenues? I mean, don't you get paid in compensating balances in a period of higher rates? I mean, at some point, do you want to look at that more holistically? And then one of your competitors recently said, let's look at performance excluding the market impact. Just questioning whether you're exploring some alternative ratios to evaluate your performance.",neutral,0.0792,0.0294,0.8915
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. A good question. So I would say there's not one absolute perfect ratio. But given that fees are our largest revenue line, we've kind of anchored to the expense to fees as an important ratio. We absolutely, though, care about operating leverage to your point as well because, obviously, we saw the power of net interest income and foreign exchange flowing through the revenues, and we're not dismissive of that. So we do look at the operating leverage but we look at that core fee operating leverage because FX, and to some degree, net interest income can have a bit more volatility to those earning streams. In terms of the second part of the question around the organic, we've been talking for several years now about how important we think the organic growth rate is in the firm. And so we do, internally, look to what type of leverage we're getting organically. So how are we growing our fees versus our expenses on a more organic basis. We've not published anything about that externally. But I would say that is absolutely, internally, one of our key drivers in metrics. It's something that I can tell you that our management team and our board look at not only our absolute financial performance, but they look at the organic performance on a regular basis. And that's the way we report it to them so they can understand what management drove versus what the macro environment drove, and under consideration that both are impactful to our business.",neutral,0.1163,0.0212,0.8625

36,Marlin Lacey Mosby,,"I want to drill in on this premium amortization and think of it more as you roll forward. Because when rates are low, you have to buy securities that have premium just because rates are rolling lower, so it kind of just creates that phenomenon. Now, rates are going higher so those securities you can buy really won't have that kind of premium. So as you're thinking of this rolling off, you have such a short duration, this premium amortization, while a new step up in a negative to net interest income, has a finite life and should be kind of replaced with bonds that don't have as much premium on them. So you could think of this in a year, all of a sudden this $19 million that goes to $12 million, goes to 0 in a reasonable period of time. So just want to see what you thought about that.",neutral,0.0578,0.1199,0.8223
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So as we said, it was $19 million in the quarter because of the true up. It was, we think, $10 million to $12 million going forward. To your point, it depends on where we're buying those instruments. If your premise, which is right, quantitatively if that continues, then we could potentially be buying them at lower premiums, which could move that $10 million to $12 million, and we'll give you updates if we think it moves off of that. I would also say though another factor, Marty, is if we change the total amount of those securities that we hold on our portfolio. So even though it may be a lower amortized amount, it's on a bigger balance that could and indeed create that still $10 million to $12 million range. We'll give updates, but right now our best thinking on that, based on the current environment, is in that $10 million to $12 million range for premium amortization.",neutral,0.1054,0.0518,0.8428
36,Marlin Lacey Mosby,,"In the securities that you're buying now, do they still have -- like you said, those securities get bigger, but they would have significant less premium than what you bought over the last couple of years I would think.",neutral,0.1354,0.0507,0.814
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"I don't know that for certain. That would make intuitive sense to me, but we'd have to confirm that to you after the point because I don't -- it makes sense from where you described it from the rate environment, that makes sense. Mathematically, I don't know if the team is buying portfolio -- if the team is buying instruments that have some different kind of premium amortization profile than what the markets would suggest. I would guess not. My guess is your premise would be right.",neutral,0.0584,0.0307,0.9109
