0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0478,0.0193,0.9329
6,Brennan Hawken,,"So curious about the -- thinking about the deposit costs, interest bank deposit costs for the non-U.S. office line. You had called out the reduction in wholesale deposits, which I'm sure was helpful, but just wanted to confirm whether or not there was any other noise falling through that line that we should think about. 
And then thinking about deposits sort of broadly, how should we think about the deposit costs for those $4 billion in interest-bearing that you flagged in your end of period resulting from the termination of the money market fund program?",neutral,0.0834,0.0962,0.8203
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Okay. On the additional color on the deposits in the foreign office deposits, in addition to the lower leveraging amounts that we highlighted, we really had 2 individual clients that accumulated large deposits in the first quarter, and they deployed them in the second quarter. We would consider that normal operating flow that we see from time to time in between quarters so we could really identify that movement in the foreign office deposits excluding those that were impacted by the lower leveraging in a handful of clients. In the case I just highlighted, 2 clients really made that move. So not uncommon for us to see builds in certain periods and then the deployment of that in other periods, and so we'd say normal flow there. 
In terms of how should we think about the pricing of the deposits in the retail space or in our wealth from the closure, if you will, of our anchor sweep product, we did offer rates for those individuals that -- attractive rates for that, that allowed those to maintain. That had a -- that has a finite period, and when that rolls off, then they will be at market rates on the competitive front.",neutral,0.1245,0.039,0.8365
34,Mark M. Bette,,"And Brennan, I would just add, if you look at the savings, money market and other line, you did see an increase sequentially in the costs, which is partly reflective of what Biff indicated but then also, the Fed increase in December, there was a lagged pricing impact in the retail deposits. So that wasn't quite fully reflected in the first quarter yet. So that's another part of the sequential impact.",neutral,0.1595,0.3824,0.4581
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. And then Biff, do you still expect -- I want to say that you had flagged during a presentation intra-quarter that you expected deposit betas to be quite high in the event of a Fed rate cut, near 100% as I recall. Is your expectation still that they would be that high? And why do you think that betas are going to be so much higher on the way down than we have seen in prior historical periods of Fed rate cuts?",neutral,0.1217,0.1453,0.733
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. I -- it's still our view that the betas will be -- let me separate first retail and institutional deposits. It's our view certainly on institutional deposits, which make up the majority of our balance sheet, that the betas will be pretty high and almost like say, almost symmetrical as they were on the way up. As the most recent betas were pretty high, we think that, that same beta favorability would happen on the way down. So perhaps not in 100%. That depends on the competitive landscape but high on the way down. So that's what we see institutionally. 
On the retail space, I think it is really a function of the competitive landscape there. So they were -- they moved up fairly slowly so we benefited from the early days of the rate hikes, and then that beta moved up over time. I think you could probably also see some of the same symmetrical path down in betas on the retail space. But there's a much more transparent market to understand the pricing there, and we need to remain competitive in that landscape. 
So I guess I'd summarize and end by saying I think we still believe that the overall, the betas will be pretty high on the way down and pretty fast. If you get closer and closer to a 0-bound for U.S. dollars, that could create some compression as we get closer to that, but there's still a few hikes before we get there.",neutral,0.2106,0.0365,0.7529
0,Operator,,"And moving on, we'll go to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.",neutral,0.0594,0.0124,0.9282
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Quick one related to fee rates. Mark, it's obviously very strong year-to-date. I'm just curious how -- particularly in the U.S., curious how breakpoints, fee caps play a role and make it hard for us to look at any custody fee rate trends. And maybe you can throw in there a comment about what kind of fee rate on the new assets coming in the door coming in.",neutral,0.0792,0.0231,0.8977
34,Mark M. Bette,,"It's Mark. There's a lot that goes into that, so we don't specifically look at fee rates internally because of really the mix of business can be quite different. So you could have a very large custody mandate with assets where the fees might be small compared to a small assets under administration mandate where the fees are larger. But -- so as far as the trends go there, it's hard to pin down something there. I would say though, that as we've highlighted before, when you look at that line, about 40% of the fees are not asset value-related. So in general, you would get the fees moving less than what you would get the assets moving, assuming that asset mix is coming out of the same rate, which it's not. I would say that some of the places where we're winning are in places that we do have, when you talk about hedge fund services and areas like that, that does usually generically, it would have a higher beta or a higher fee rate and what say, domestic custody would have as a -- for instance.",neutral,0.0529,0.0584,0.8888
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. Glenn, I would just add, second part of your question was the new assets coming on board, the fee rates. I think Mark's point is important there as the types of wins we're having where it's growth, and I think we mentioned Magnetar and Anchorage hedge funds. Those still -- there's still good value added and the fee base there and then there's other large just pure asset servicing custody wins where the competitive landscape, the basis point yield might be a bit lower. So you've got to really look at the mix coming in, and we've got a pretty nice mix, both globally and product set mix, so we get a nice blend of rates coming in on the new business. It's not all just in lower margin fee rate business.",neutral,0.1271,0.0277,0.8452
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"I appreciate all that. Maybe 1 quick follow-up to Brennan's question. The -- I hear you loud and clear on the high betas on the way down on the institutional side. I'm curious, is there a difference in client segment -- by client segment in the retail side? I'm surprised to see such rate sensitivity. It's not what I think of when I think of Northern Trust Wealth Management.",neutral,0.0444,0.0556,0.8999
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. I think what you have to look at there is you've got to look at the beta over a much longer period than just 1 quarter because we could have been behind the market, slower to the market over periods of time, and you can see beta moves in certain periods that look larger than a beta than you expect because we're catching up from some competitive landscape. And I will still say, it is still competitive for even high net worth deposits. You've got sophisticated investors who are looking when yields get to some differential with the market that are seeking, at least for the cash portion of their business balances, they're looking for market rates, and so we need to remain competitive. It may not be quite as dependent -- as competitive as those that are relying on retail deposits but it remains competitive.",neutral,0.1958,0.0234,0.7808
0,Operator,,"And next, we'll go to Mike Carrier with Bank of America.",neutral,0.0368,0.0174,0.9458
41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Maybe the first one, just on the expense growth, so that's been coming in better this quarter and year-to-date versus kind of the targeted in line with the organic growth rate. Just curious, should we be expecting maybe any new spend like in the second half of this year? Or could that be coming in lower just given the revenue backdrop and some of the uncertainty, whether it's -- you mentioned some of the FX but also the rate backdrop.",positive,0.562,0.0918,0.3462
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So here, I would say the environment we're operating in, it's not lost on us, right? So a net interest income environment that looks like it will become more difficult in terms of the -- where rates are moving. So we really want to continue to drive our organic revenue and our franchise, but we have to be mindful of the macro headwinds that we're facing. We can't just singularly focus on that. 
So that means I think the disciplines that you've seen in the first 6 months of this year, and I think even longer term than that, they have -- they're vital to our profitability. They have to remain. So we are focused on certain disciplined capital deployment for projects, return-seeking projects, disciplined expense management around occupancy, procurement, business promotion, location strategies, automation driving it, organizational design, all things we've talked about, those are even more in focus. They've been in focus. You've seen the benefits of our focus of them, but they're even more in focus as we are recognizing the environment that we're entering. 
And I can tell you that I think some of the cultural behaviors that we've embedded as a part of Value for Spend are now part of the disciplines that will help us, we think, continue to execute on that in the second half of this year and in the future. So there is not a planned ramp in those expenses because we are -- we're certainly cognizant of the environment we're operating in, and there is a strong focus on maintaining those. What I will say, though, and want to be clear is we think our organic growth rate is still a very important governor, if I could say that, on what is allowable for that expense growth rate. So we still want to grow our franchise organically, and there is some expense needed to fuel that organic growth. But as long as that's proportional and appropriate with enough spread in it, we think we can move it forward and move the profitability the firm forward.",neutral,0.2437,0.0156,0.7407
41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Okay. And then I just wanted to follow up on NII. So you mentioned your expectations on deposit betas, and then just if we go down the path of getting a few Fed cuts, just anything from like a positioning or duration, the balance sheet, like has anything changed? Or do you expect anything? And then just so I'm clear on like the deposits, you mentioned on the institutional side some of the activity that you saw on the non-U.S. You mentioned some of the things that you guys do on like the deleveraging. And then it sounds like on the retail side, you're seeing some money move on. When we just think about the start to jump off on, is that roughly unchanged because you had the depression like of the institutional but you're having the retail come on board?",neutral,0.0763,0.0449,0.8788
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. Let me break that into 2 parts. One, you're talking about the balance sheet jump-off point sort of from a size. And then the first is sort of, I think, more of an outlook on net interest income, and I think we'll give a little color there. I would imagine people want to hear that. 
If you looked at our net interest income from the Q1 to Q2, when we stripped out, there was some favorable impact from the lower FX swap activity, but we implemented BOLI, which we took our earning assets down. If you netted those out, our sequential decline was probably just under 3%. I know we reported 1% but those factors moved it around. If we look at the current implied curve and we assumed 2 rate cuts in July and September, we would think in the third quarter that we would see about a 2% to 3% decline in net interest income from this quarter's reported net interest income, and that includes the impact of BOLI and other things in there, so we would see somewhere around 2% to 3%. 
In the fourth quarter of this year, we would say flat to slightly down from there. And again, that's reliant on a whole series of factors. How did the betas play out? How does our balance sheet play out over that time in terms of volume and mix? There's a lot of factors. But based on our best modeling and our best forecast at this point, relatively modest decline in net interest income in Q3 and flat to slightly down in Q4 based on our current thinking in there. In terms of the balance sheet size, Mark if you want to...",negative,0.0496,0.7234,0.2271
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Yes. I would -- I guess if you look at the average balance sheet and you're thinking about that as your starting point, and which is probably the best thing to do because we do have period-end deposit flows that spike up, the one thing I would point to is this change in the sweep product in Wealth Management where that was really only a partial quarter. It happened at different points throughout the quarter. So for that line, the savings, money market and other looking at the end of period for that might be a little bit closer to where it might run during the quarter, but that remains to be determined. But that's how I would position as far as a balance sheet jump-off point.",neutral,0.0795,0.0641,0.8564
0,Operator,,"And next, we'll go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.",neutral,0.0353,0.0188,0.9458
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"A couple of follow-ups to that. One is if your rate cuts were all in July, if you got your rate cuts in July, is there a material change to the numbers you just described or not really?",neutral,0.0542,0.0794,0.8664
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Not really. In fact, it might be very, very modestly better to get 50 basis points than 2 25s. A 50 and a 25 would -- we would probably have to get back to you what that is, but we know it is, but it might be a little bit more impacting. But a 50 is very modestly better. So I would -- I could say roughly for your projections probably about equal over 2 quarters.",neutral,0.0898,0.0519,0.8583
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then can you just give us some color as to what the decisioning was behind the BOLI? What was the reason for that? And should we expect more either BOLI-like types of transactions going forward or other securities, asset repositioning that you might be doing in a changing rate environment?",neutral,0.0422,0.0244,0.9334
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. We have -- as you know, we've embarked on what I will call a balance sheet optimization-type program, and we've looked at certain asset classes or certain yield opportunities on our balance sheet. We had no BOLI investments, which made us relatively unique in the marketplace. And in the current yield environment and particularly with the declining rate environment, the benefits of that actually were pretty powerful. As we cited, it's $14 million of benefit in net income. For our franchise, it does take down NII...",positive,0.6856,0.0146,0.2998
34,Mark M. Bette,,On an annualized...,neutral,0.0722,0.0175,0.9103
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"On an annualized basis, it does take down our NII, but it will flow-through the other income line, and you saw some of the benefit of that in just sort of 1/2 of 1 quarter. We're always looking at optimization efforts. I can't say whether we would add more or less BOLI, for instance, in this transaction, but this was our first pass at it.",neutral,0.1672,0.086,0.7468
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"I guess I was just wondering like how you decided to size it the way you did. Was it as you kind of indicated, you were the only one who didn't have it, so was there a relative positioning vis-à-vis peers? Or -- I'm just trying to wonder why $1 billion.",neutral,0.0424,0.062,0.8956
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Sure. There's several factors that, A, limit the size. There's regulations as to how much as a percent of your capital that you can have. But remember, we have counterparty credit exposure then that we have to go out to with very high credit quality carriers that we now have this credit exposure to. And so our credit group also is providing input as to the sizing of the portfolio. And when we put all that together, it added up to $1 billion for now.",neutral,0.0692,0.0253,0.9055
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. So you would say -- I should take from that, that you're optimized on the BOLI positioning?",neutral,0.1618,0.01,0.8282
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"As we sit here today, that's -- we have $1 billion in there. We -- we're always looking at those opportunities. I can't say whether we'd go higher or lower in the future, but I think we're here for some period of time.",neutral,0.1341,0.0381,0.8278
0,Operator,,"And next, we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.",neutral,0.0355,0.0203,0.9441
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Thanks for the NIR guidance. I know you guys typically don't get into explicit guidance but given where we're in the cycle, I think it was definitely appreciated, so thanks for that. A question for you guys around expenses again. So given the fact that historically, you've been sort of aiming to align expense growth with organic fee growth, so call it 4-ish percent, 5-ish percent or something like that. In light of a tougher backdrop from NIR, and that obviously tends to be a much higher-margin type of business for you guys, is there an emphasis to potentially bring that down below the organic fee growth levels? In other words, could we still anticipate some of the positive kind of operating leverage or dynamic even with your current NIR outlook?",neutral,0.172,0.1995,0.6285
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. I think we are looking at that hard, Alex. As like you said, we can't ignore the backdrop we're in, and pressure on one of our important revenue lines, net interest income, may put additional pressure that we have to look at on our expense line to widen out that leverage that you're talking about. Some things will naturally happen there. I think it's important. For instance, I will tell you certain cash-based incentive plans. If net interest income goes down, they're going down. So that will give us some natural reduction in our expense lines if that's the backdrop. But then the discretionary items I described, we may have to continue to push harder and harder on some of those levers to widen out, if you will, the organic leverage in our business, to overcome, if you will, some of the pressures we see on net interest income, for instance.",neutral,0.35,0.2412,0.4088
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Yes. Second question around foreign exchange trading. So last quarter, I believe there was a $13 million swap benefit in that line, so I kind of think apples to apples, you've seen an improvement sequentially and in a fairly difficult environment. So curious again kind of -- and I know that's been a focus for you guys to kind of drive some of the organic initiatives in foreign exchange trading to gain some market share, so maybe a little bit on kind of what's going on underneath the surface within that part of the business and any better way for us to think about kind of the go forward?",positive,0.6496,0.0171,0.3333
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So you're right. At the core, the core FX actually did pretty well if you'd strip the swap impact out of that. I think there's a couple of factors in there. One is we saw our share of FX transactions that we got from our client base increased from quarter-over-quarter. So we're communicating, marketing better products and capabilities, so we captured a higher percent share of trade. Even in a lower volatility environment, we've captured more share of trade. And we also saw a little bit higher volume in some of the emerging market currencies in the quarter from our client base. I don't know if that's true for everyone but from our client base, that in of itself, also has a little wider spread. So the combination of those 2, I think, actually drove a relatively good core FX performance quarter-over-quarter.",positive,0.8682,0.026,0.1058

27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"So I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the securities book. Appreciate all the detailed NII guidance. And as we model the securities yield and layer in the forward curve, can you just remind us what percentage of the book reprices each quarter? And where does the overall duration of the book sit today given some of the extensions you've been doing?",neutral,0.0345,0.0351,0.9304
34,Mark M. Bette,,"So the overall duration of the book, let me answer the second part, is at 1.3 years, and we have been adding some duration, you're right. But that duration that we've added has been somewhat muted as the longer rates have come down and obviously creates a view of faster prepayments. And so that has the impact of shortening the durations, so we're lengthening it with our purchases, but the actual come-down of the rates in the long end of the curve mutes it. But we're still longer at 1.3 than we've been traditionally where we've run probably closer to 1 or 1.1 on the terms of the duration.",negative,0.0963,0.5892,0.3145
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"As far as the repricing goes, we've talked about before how our securities portfolio is kind of divided between a shorter and a longer. The shorter book is probably -- it's a little bit less than half of the total securities book, and that's where you would get mostly when you think about 1-month LIBOR and 3-month LIBOR, that repricing would happen fairly quick, obviously, within a quarter. And then the other part of the book, the longer book, that, as you get securities rolling over, you put something on 2 years ago, it rolls over and then you reinvest that. So that would happen on more of a staggered basis across a period of time.",neutral,0.0361,0.0866,0.8773
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"And just 1 follow-up for me on some of the deposit growth commentary. I think there's a big debate about how much of the rate headwinds can be offset with volume growth. And you noted that deposit betas should be elevated on the way down. But just given overall a more sophisticated client base, how are you guys thinking about the pace of organic deposit growth that you can generate within both retail and institutional? And just looking out to the forward curve, you gave some very helpful detail on '19. Just as we look out to 2020, do you believe there's a path to generating sufficient NII or volume growth to offset some of those rate headwinds?",neutral,0.2218,0.0152,0.763
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"If we look out the 2020, I would say we're going to start to become more reliant on an organic growth rate that we've talked to you before in our asset servicing business primarily to drive the custody growth and the deposit growth that you're talking about. We could be more aggressive in our pricing to try to attract deposits. But given the construct of our balance sheet, that type of funding need has to make good economic sense for us to want to do it. And we don't have a big loan portfolio to fund, for instance. So I think the growth rate in our deposits is going to come from at least some -- most of that will come from just the organic growth we've seen in our fees. 
So if we've talked about 4% to 5%, some portion of that would come with deposits. Not all of it because we do fund administration and other work which may not come with custody deposits on the balance sheet, but much of it comes with custody deposits. So I think that becomes more of the benchmark for the balance sheet growth. And to your point, depending on how rates move, it probably would be difficult to make it up with volume to your point. 
What I would say is if we get more than 2 insurance type cuts that the Fed may -- that we would project, but you put your projection on it, if we get more than 2 and we start to get into something that looks more like quantitative easing, historically, I think the custody banks have been the recipients of the liquidity that's pumped into the system. And so we could see deposit growth and balance sheet growth move at a much faster rate if this becomes more than a 1 or 2 rate cut cycle.",neutral,0.1296,0.0301,0.8403
0,Operator,,"Moving on, we'll go to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.",neutral,0.0381,0.0199,0.9421
41,James Francis Mitchell,,"Just 2 questions. First, maybe one last one on the deposits. Noninterest-bearing actually was flat on a sequential basis while your peers were down. They've been highlighting declines going forward. I guess is that sort of that organic growth you were talking about? What's keeping your noninterest-bearing flat? And how do you think about that over the next, I guess, looking over the next couple of quarters?",negative,0.0453,0.5482,0.4065
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. Let me walk you through that again. So we had about $18 billion in average noninterest-bearing deposits, I think, in the quarter. And if you look at those, about 85% of those are in dollar. So of the dollar deposits noninterest-bearing, 25% are Wealth Management deposits. Those have been historically very sticky, and they have remained sticky for a long time. Another 25% are sort of our treasury cash management business. They're there for balances to pay fees, et cetera. Those 2 have been fairly sticky. 
So I think you've got kind of half of the dollar-based noninterest-bearing that have been and remain pretty sticky. That leaves sort of the other 50% there which are part of core institutional asset servicing. Many of those, we think, are just part of operational needs and been there. We kind of talked about $3 billion to $4 billion sort of being, what I would say, was perhaps yield-seeking that was sitting there in noninterest-bearing. And we've seen -- we have regular dialogues with those clients. We believe those are also there for the liquidity purposes. We certainly have seen runoff in noninterest-bearing over the year. But more frequently, we think most of that has sought -- the yield-seeking piece that have sought yield already. So we've seen a little bit more stability in noninterest-bearing in the last 2 quarters.",neutral,0.0599,0.1849,0.7552
41,James Francis Mitchell,,"Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just bigger picture, I know you guys have been talking about efforts to boost organic growth and wealth. Maybe you can just sort of update us on what you've been doing there and what -- any evidence you had of that accelerating, that will be helpful.",neutral,0.2851,0.014,0.7009
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So we -- as you could see with our Wealth Management reported figures, they had a strong quarter, very strong quarter, very healthy margins and good fee growth rate year-over-year, some of that driven by markets but some of that driven by organic. And again, they continue to look at geographies where we have -- want to increase our market share. We don't always have to have a physical presence as we've talked in the past. There are certain cities and markets where we've got -- grown our market share without having to have a physical presence, and those are generally very attractive pieces of business with low physical overhead needed to get there. We can serve it out of Chicago or Florida or New York or wherever. 
And then I would say our product suite, particularly our holistic advice, our Goals Powered solutioning, has resonated and particularly resonated with people in an environment where we've seen a little bit more volatility, certainly interest rate uncertainty. Markets are favorable, but you've got a lot of people looking at the landscape, the geopolitical landscape, and there's some certainties on the horizons. And so we think our technology and tools led to pretty increased strong organic growth in that business as well.",positive,0.6625,0.014,0.3236

36,Marlin Lacey Mosby,,"I wanted to ask you about the leverage -- the deleverage this particular quarter. It looked like they were deposits that were outside the United States and were you kind of using that as a source of being able to take some wholesale funding, very low and then redeployed it in the United States at a higher rate? Is that some of the FX translation? Is that why you wanted to get out of it? What was the motivation for it? And what was the trigger to get out of the leveraging strategy you had out there?",neutral,0.0588,0.0392,0.902
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Well, I'll split this question with Mark. But the strategy for getting out of it is, Marty, the wholesale funding. The return on it, quite frankly, has gone to about 0. So from a return -- given an incremental return, the cost of wholesale funding and the investment that we were putting it in was generating a very low to no return in this environment. So we took the decision to pull some of the leveraging off. And I think, Marty, the currency or the -- where it sits on the balance sheet, these are euro-dollar deposits.

So we weren't -- we're not crossing currencies with it so we're keeping it in U.S. dollars, and it is -- you do see it certainly short-term borrowings in other line where we do -- we'll do sprint biddings that are home loan bank borrowings. And then the wholesale deposits flow-through the non-U.S. office line. So it's a combination of those 2 that we use for leveraging purposes. But we -- it is on the liability side, U.S. dollars, and then U.S. dollars on the asset side as well.",neutral,0.0399,0.0261,0.9339
36,Marlin Lacey Mosby,,"Got you. And then we've talked extensively -- I've been an advocate for expanding the duration to protect NII as you end up having these declines. What is your perspective in the sense of doing, not doing that as you gone through the cycle? And why wouldn't we have been more proactive and defensive to protect against a fairly valuable part of our income stream, which is this net interest income?",neutral,0.1688,0.0353,0.7959
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So Marty, over a year ago, we start talking about here about the duration extension of the portfolio and have been executing on that. I know at 1.3, that still seems perhaps short in duration to the average. But for our portfolio, that's a fairly meaningful increase. And again, we take that duration. We don't do it through any credit additions. It's generally done through duration of treasuries and added. So we have been doing some of that over the periods, and there obviously are other hedges and swaps and other things that we can do into the portfolio to help look at that. 
So we've been -- I would say we've been contemplating a rate move for at least 1 year from our ALCO and have been executing on some of that behind the scenes. So I think it's one of the reasons our -- actually our net interest income and others has held up reasonably well. Obviously, we continue to look at that. And some of those decisions now, with the way the shape of the yield curve is right now, there is some NII give up in protecting against the -- a long-term move down in rates, as you might imagine, based on where the very short end of the curve is now versus the long end. And -- but we have taken some of those decisions. So thanks.",neutral,0.1453,0.0571,0.7976

12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Biff, just one more thing on the NII first. So if I take the $3.5 million impact from the BOLI and then the $29 million for the year, effectively, are you saying that, that the decline in 3Q is really just from the BOLI and that core NII dollars are basically going to be flattish? Is that the right way to think about it?",neutral,0.0512,0.4707,0.4782
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Well, this is Mark. You would -- we also had a benefit from the FX swap so -- but in a way, you're right. I mean, if you added back BOLI, you would be flat, but that was because of the fact that we had a benefit from the FX swaps, which was basically offset by what we saw play out with the interest rate environment.",neutral,0.3085,0.0616,0.6299
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Right. Okay. And then my second question, just on the cost side. So Value for Spend is expected to run rate by the end of this year, and it's been a 3 percentage point helper to the cost growth rate. So as we look out into past 2019 -- or sorry, it's going to run rate by next year. But you've gotten a good chunk of it already. So the magnitude of help, does it stay the same as you go forward? Like are we going to expect 3 percentage points of help on an ongoing basis? Or do you have to think about re-upping the plan at some point to maintain this right balance? Any thoughts there?",neutral,0.1109,0.0219,0.8672
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. Thanks, Ken. So your thinking is right. The 2% to 3% kind of per-annum benefit that you've talked about is what we are seeing. In terms of will we re-up Value for Spend, let me frame it this way. The answer to that is to meet the sort of the financial model that we've talked about, which has set an organic fee growth rate, we've talked 4% to 5%, then we look at our expense base beneath that and we say we've got certain inflationary price expenses coming at us. We've got certain investments that we want to make and, we've got certain expenses that we need to fuel that 4% to 5% growth rate. 
If we want to get leverage in that equation, I guarantee you, you would need a productivity offset to make that math work. So if you got 4% to 5% growth rate, you add in inflationary expenses, you add in investment needs, you add in the expenses needed to grow that 4% to 5%, you probably produce something higher than a 4% to 5% expense growth rate. What we're saying is that needs to be the productivity we need to get on an annual basis in our franchise to drive leverage into that business. 
And your magnitude is in the area code that we're thinking about, the 2% to 3% kind of range every year. A good way we think about it is it's got to be at least as much to offset inflation. So if our expense improvements have to be at least enough to offset inflation, then you have your cost to drive the new business and you've got some available for investment. And that's the way we think about it. The more we drive in productivity, the more we share in profitability and investment opportunities for the firm.",neutral,0.1311,0.0233,0.8456

10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"Biff, can you -- I know the modeling is challenging and nobody can really predict the future on interest rates with 100% accuracy, but I recognize we're all focused on the short end of the curve. What happens in your guys' outlook if the long end of the curve actually rises due to maybe a trade settlement with China, stronger economy, and we're looking at a [ 2 and 3/4 ] 10-year in the first going into the first of next year. How does that affect what you guys have been talking about on net interest income?",neutral,0.0659,0.0631,0.871
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"I think, Gerard, the answer to that is that it probably depends on how the steepness of the curve moves between the short end and the long end. So if the long end moves up and the short end moves up in parallel, it's a different impact that if the short end stays where it is and the long end moves up and we get steepness in the curve. From a loan book perspective, we don't have nearly as much mortgage-based credit that's going to be impacted by the type of move you're talking about in the long end of the curve. So I would say less impactful to us in that space. But the investment opportunities along the curve and the spread they offer from the short end of the curve does matter to us. So I guess I would have to say it depends on how the rest of the curve shifts with that move in the long end.",neutral,0.0549,0.1026,0.8425
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"Okay. Yes. Because I was assuming your short end [  drops 50 ] but the long end stays, so you have a so-called bull steepener in the curve, is what I was thinking. But thank you. And the second question, when you guys step back and you look at the challenges that companies always face and opportunities that you guys have, what are some of -- aside from interest rates since we've talked about that, what are some of the challenges that you guys foresee that you have to overcome maybe in the next 12 or 18 months when you look out of the businesses?",neutral,0.0639,0.0498,0.8863
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"I would say if we look -- there's always a significant demand for technological investment for our business, and we compete particularly on the asset servicing side in a highly technologically driven field and so making sure we make the right investments in that technology to remain competitive. Along with the word competitive, I would say we are in a competitive marketplace. And while I would say we have seen pretty similar type fee pressures that we talked about in the past, compression of 1.5% to 2% in the marketplace, we're in a competitive environment with good competitors. And so we want to monitor the competitive nature there. So we got to remain vigilant to the competitive landscape on the horizon. 
And on the wealth space, I think it's one of opportunity. So what -- you asked what the challenges are. I think for that, it's what are the right pockets to grow in. Where do we want to -- where do we have less market share than we would like? And where can we get to that client base because where we are established, we do very well in those markets, and I think there's opportunity for us in certain markets where we're maybe underrepresented.",neutral,0.2637,0.018,0.7183

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Quick question on the expenses, the trust and investment fees and when it came down again this quarter. It's been kind of trending lower over the past couple of years. But given your pullback on expenses, are you still expecting that to trend lower from here? Is it just a more challenged environment which is expected to kind of flatten out for a while?",negative,0.014,0.9477,0.0383
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"So that question I would say we do hope that over long periods to evaluate that, that we want to continue to drive more productivity in. So we've not achieved sort of nirvana in terms of that rate. What I think we have to be cautious of is we have seasonality in our business, for instance, next quarter, we have the Northern Trust Open, which puts pressure on expenses in a quarter. And obviously, markets can be volatile and drive the fee line, and our expenses can't necessarily react in 90 days to a market that can move. 
So -- but if you look over longer periods of time, the answer is there is continued focus on driving that down. And I would give you an example. If you do these calculations between our 2 businesses, they're quite different. And the mature Wealth Management business does drive that expense a few ratio lower than the [ 1:5 ] for instance. And so I would say the answer is over long measurement periods, they're still absolutely focused inside the firm on continuing to improve that. You may see quarterly moves that go up or down just based on seasonality and/or market volatility.",negative,0.0668,0.5334,0.3998

35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. It's -- so I think we've talked to you about premium amortization being somewhere around the $10 million to $12 million in a quarter, and it was inside of that range in this quarter, yes.
