0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0439,0.022,0.9341
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Great. Just -- maybe just back on the expense real quick. If you -- I didn't see it in the press release, the bifurcation between severance and litigation in the fourth quarter. And then as we think about the expense trajectory into 2020 and even '21, can you just talk about the investments in technology and how you expect that to reduce the structural cost base over the next couple of years?",neutral,0.0915,0.0303,0.8782
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,You want to take...,neutral,0.0597,0.0254,0.9148
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Brian, it's Mike. So on the first piece, we didn't disclose the exact number and the split between the 2. I think you can get a pretty good sense of the magnitude of the severance by looking at the staff expense and the difference versus the third quarter. So that will probably give you a good sense of the magnitude there. The bigger piece by far was severance in the number. 
As you sort of think about overall expenses, as both Todd and I mentioned, we would expect to invest even more this year than we did in 2019. And really, it's across a range of items, both continuing to build out our -- the infrastructure that is important for operating our businesses. We're building new capabilities, and you're seeing some of those get announced and released even over the last couple of weeks. And then there's a large chunk that's going into sort of the efficiency agenda on the cost side, as you've sort of suggested there. 
And I think working with Lester Owens, our Head of Operations, we've got a very long list of those programs that we're just clicking down the list and executing. And as you can imagine, the benefits of those continue to come in the P&L over a period of time. So we'll get some of them in 2020, and we'll get some of them as we sort of exit '20 into '21. 
And I'll just sort of reinforce what Todd said in his remarks. You can see the benefits of those investments and efficiency agenda coming through the P&L already as we've sort of increased the technology spend significantly in '19 and overall expenses are down, and that's a result of that focus.",neutral,0.137,0.061,0.802
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Okay. That's helpful. And then on clearing, just on the actual clearing service fees of $421 million, just given the way the markets have moved in DARTS and the online brokerage industry at least have been pretty strong, if you want to just -- I would have expected that line to be a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis, so if there's anything that you can call out what maybe depressed that? 
And then maybe longer term, you talked about within Pershing and the RIA strategy. Maybe what are your expectations of potentially picking up market share given the industry consolidation that's upon us here?",positive,0.4979,0.013,0.4892
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Look, I'll take some of it. In terms of the -- yes, why don't I take the second piece. In terms of the industry consolidation and how we kind of look at that, I mean we're a little different because Pershing is more B2B and we serve broker-dealers and corporate IRAs. And we've also kind of differentiated ourselves because we provide a choice, whether that's related to the open investment platform that we've got or the ability to integrate best-in-class kind of front-office system. So our clients have the choice as far as that goes, and I think that will, in the long term, be the preference. 
Right now, the desire for choice seems to make it more of an opportunity. What I mean by that is just the consolidation probably, as we look at it, makes it more of an opportunity. There's a lot of interest in alternative providers, and that just puts us in a better position. 
As to the revenue growth, I think we're seeing some pretty decent positives there as we have won some meaningful new business that we are implementing. Mike, I don't know if you have any...",neutral,0.4623,0.0126,0.5251
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. And I would just -- yes, Brian, on our revenue stream, we're not a commission-based revenue stream. And so most of the revenue that we see come through the clearing services fee line is not based on number of transactions that are getting executed. It's actually a very small piece of the puzzle there. So you won't see the same correlation between transaction activity and our revenue stream as you might with some of the online brokers.",neutral,0.0426,0.0771,0.8804
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"But we've got a pretty strong pipeline there. We continue to win new business. We are differentiated on the institutional side with some of our capabilities. And we're investing on the adviser side, both in the sales as well as -- the sales team, the branding as well as the technology that we're deploying. So we feel pretty good about the business.",positive,0.7522,0.0093,0.2384

6,Brennan Hawken,,"I just wanted to ask a couple, first on expenses. You guys guided to an expense growth of 2% or less. So is the expectation that you're going to be able to deliver operating leverage and, therefore, you expect there to be a revenue growth picture that's going to be at least 2%, maybe a little greater? And can you help us understand why there's such a big delay on the severance benefit?",neutral,0.4028,0.0342,0.563
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Thanks, Brennan. I'll take the start of that, and then Mike can provide a little more color. In terms of the environment, delivering positive operating leverage is really going to be driven by revenue mix as much as anything right now as we continue to make investments in the technology that we think will have longer-term benefits to us. So I think it would be -- it's certainly not impossible but challenged in the very near term. I don't know, Mike if you had...",positive,0.5917,0.0109,0.3974
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Look -- and I do think though, Brennan, once you sort of get through the NIR stabilization, we feel very confident still sort of in sort of the model where a little bit of revenue growth drives a significant amount of earnings growth. And so we think that's still -- we feel very confident that that still holds. And once NIR stabilized, which, as I mentioned, we think is -- under the assumptions I sort of gave you, we think that happens later this year, then you should start to see some of that come back into the picture.",neutral,0.4322,0.0175,0.5502
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Great. That's fair. And on that point, Mike, there were some encouraging signs here on the noninterest-bearing deposits. Can you talk a little bit, give us a little more color on trends there in that line this quarter? And how sustainable should we -- I know you -- I think you said that they're down from December levels, which is probably pretty seasonally typical, but like with the interest rates coming down in the market, should -- is that -- are those trends now like more durable, some stability there and maybe even some growth? And do you have some deposit efforts specifically intended to help support growth in that line as well?",neutral,0.1678,0.3047,0.5275
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Look, I think I'll start on the last piece and sort of try to make sure I hit all your points. But we've been -- as I said in my script, we've been sort of focused on this for a while now, and that includes going after opportunities where there's noninterest-bearing deposits. And part of the episodic activity that we saw in the fourth quarter was very targeted activity that we go after related to escrow, as an example, where there's some significant sort of transactions there. It's hard to predict when they're going to come and how they're going to come, but it's not -- but it's an intentional act on our part to go out and target those opportunities. 
As you sort of think about the path forward, I think the macro environment certainly should be helpful, and we're encouraged by sort of the level of dialogue and the activity we're seeing. And we'll have to let it play out a little bit longer to sort of call a sustainable trend, I think.",neutral,0.145,0.0302,0.8249
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. You guys have picked up on the correlation to the Fed's balance sheet and the impact that it's likely to have on us. So that could be somewhat of a positive. And then the rest of it is going to be also rate-driven. So if there's a change in the rate environment, it would -- it could potentially move in that category as well.",neutral,0.1933,0.0404,0.7663
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0316,0.0284,0.94
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Todd, at the beginning you highlighted a variety of areas that should be able to deliver growth. I wondered if you could give us a sense as to what is the most important 1 or 2 areas that you're looking for to deliver growth this year? And I'm asking the question in part to understand the context for the investment spend and where it's most critical for you.",neutral,0.0837,0.0167,0.8996
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Well, I think the investment spend is kind of coming across the board. So we're spending -- Mike talked a little bit about just building stronger and stronger infrastructure for resiliency which just provides an increase in the quality of our services. We are investing in integrating third-party capabilities, which I think is a bit of a differentiator. We are investing in improving operations, and we're starting to see the positive feedback from that in the scorecards that our clients keep on us. The most important thing is to retain business, and by providing great service and covering -- and increasingly better capabilities around that service, it's difficult for clients to leave. 
In terms of initiatives that might drive future revenues, there are really kind of 3 areas -- 3 or 4 areas where I'm most focused. One is the things that we've talked about in the Clearing and Collateral Management. So we are building an interoperable tri-party system, which we think will make our clients much more effective in managing their collateral globally. And as a result, we can pick up some of the global market share and also provide some of those services to what have traditionally been in the bilat space. That's a -- that's probably another year or 2 before I think that really -- that kicks in, but we're starting to see some of the benefits from that now. 
One of our other focus areas is around data and analytics. And I think this is going to be an increasingly competitive advantage for us. As we build -- we currently with the -- under Eagle have approximately $24 trillion of assets under management. Eagle is the digital brand name of our data and analytics capability. As we've built on that platform what we call a data vault, we think we've got an exciting capability where we will see growth this year and will provide the ability to do -- for our clients to do deep analysis around the structured data that's on our platform. 
We're investing in our Wealth Management platform. That's more long term as well. And we've already talked a little bit about the investments that we're making at Pershing. So I'd say those 4 are -- in terms of business growth are where my key focus is.",neutral,0.3316,0.0128,0.6556
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. No, I think I'd echo what Todd said on the bigger priorities. But I think the good part is that each of the -- we really do feel that each of the businesses still have some opportunity to grow. Some of them require bigger investment, some of them require smaller investment. And so I think we're focused really on each of them to make sure we get -- we take advantage of those opportunities.",neutral,0.1455,0.0149,0.8397
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then Mike, for you specifically, or Todd can chime in too, but on the capital, you highlighted that the SLR under the new will be up I think to what, 7.3% or 7.2% or something like that. I know I've asked on this call many times about pref and what your intentions are there. Now that we have the final rule set in, maybe you could speak to what opportunities you have to become a little bit more capital-efficient there. And I'm not sure if it has to wait until the CCAR given where the SLR came in.",neutral,0.1481,0.015,0.8369
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Look, I think that's a large, Betsy, sort of one piece of the puzzle in terms of the rules that are sort of being discussed and contemplated. And so I think we really do need to look at all of the rules that are still a work in process around stress capital buffer and all the related pieces of it before we have a complete picture on how we're going to optimize the capital stack.",neutral,0.0567,0.0266,0.9167

2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Well, for sponsored repo, that doesn't have any impact on the size of our balance sheet. And so to take advantage of opportunities like that, we don't need to -- we don't need capital to do that.",neutral,0.0733,0.0201,0.9067

2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"So I think -- look, I think we're going to look at all of the options to figure out what our opportunity is on the revenue side to sort of grow and keep the balance sheet where it is or grow the balance sheet, and we're going to look at sort of our opportunities given sort of the new capital rules. And I think you'll hear more from us on that as CCAR and stress capital stuff comes into focus hopefully over the next few months.",neutral,0.3828,0.0117,0.6054
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. It's a little bit challenging because we just don't know exactly what the rules are going to be.

4,Alexander Blostein,,"So just a couple of follow-ups. So one, I guess on expenses. Mike, maybe just to clarify. The base of what you guys are talking about 2020 expense growth is about $10.8 billion, kind of the core number that you reported in 2019?",neutral,0.0455,0.0411,0.9134

4,Alexander Blostein,,"Yes. And then when you talk about the tech spend, you guys had $3 billion or so in 2019. I just want to make sure. Is that all running through the income statement? And again, it sounded like that was a 10% growth in 2019. How much of a growth rate do you guys expect to see there for 2020? Basically, just kind of trying to get a flavor for how much you need to range in your -- in savings to keep the overall expenses below the 2% range.",neutral,0.0805,0.0377,0.8817
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I think most of it's running through the P&L already, Alex, so -- for 2019. So most of it's going through the P&L. So I think we're not -- I don't think we've given you the exact percentage increase that's going to go up, but we're continuing to deliver consistent sort of efficiency gains as we go. And as you and I and others have sort of talked about over time, like we still think there's a long road ahead of efficiencies that we can generate through these investments we're making. So we feel pretty confident that we're going to be able to get at those over the next couple of years.",positive,0.8235,0.0171,0.1594
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Right. And my second question around the Asset Management business. So when I look at the flow dynamics, fixed income, LDI was a little light this quarter again, despite what has been a really strong trend in the industry. And then cash management also I think, had some outflows. Can you provide a little bit of color kind of what's been driving that? And then the market performance, also a sizably negative number, which obviously is surprising given what the markets had done. And also maybe kind of help flesh out what's driven both the flows and the market delta this quarter.",negative,0.223,0.4639,0.3131
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Look, I think on LDI, it isn't a -- it's not going to be a straight line sort of up as you sort of think about flows in that business. And there's been lots happening in sort of the U.K. pension market that sort of made people sort of make sure they were sort of thinking about sort of how to manage their liabilities in the right way. And we feel really good still about the pipeline and the unfunded commitments that we've got in that business in the U.K. Plus they've been continuing to invest in bringing their capabilities outside of that -- of their core market. 
So I think we still feel good about the LDI space. We feel good about what they're doing. Performance has been good. And so we don't really have any concerns in the LDI space really at all. And as you know, just more broadly, about our Asset Management business, it's largely an institutional set of clients. And so you're going to have some chunky, chunky flows from time to time for various reasons as you sort of look at any given quarter. And so there's nothing underneath the fixed income side that I would sort of point to that is a core issue or a core trend that we're concerned about.",neutral,0.1603,0.0299,0.8098
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Well then, you also had a question around market. And I think one of the things to keep in mind, we have a fairly substantial exposure to the U.K., where there were -- I mean the currency impacts and the equity impacts are a little bit different than they would have been domestically. So that's one thing I would throw in there. In terms of the cash, I would say that's a little disappointing, and I think we need to work to do a little better there.",positive,0.4844,0.1853,0.3303

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,Quick question on the deposit optimization that you talked about. Just trying to get a sense of how far along you are in that process. It sounds like you did that over the course of 2019. Or is it like there's still a long runway to deposit optimization from here?,neutral,0.0446,0.0503,0.9051
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Look, I think Brian, it's a -- we're continuing to optimize. So I think the -- this is a dialogue that is a very granular conversation with clients, and it's a client-by-client sort of dialogue. And so I think we've made some progress, but we've got more to go to continue to make sure that we're optimizing sort of the pricing and footprint we've got there, so...",neutral,0.283,0.0212,0.6958
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Okay. And then separately, is there any way to kind of give an update on how the Aladdin offering is moving forward? Still some concern across the industry whether or not proprietary versus third-party solutions is the way it's moving. Do you have any update there?",neutral,0.0653,0.0311,0.9036
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Sure. We've been building on a number of partnerships over the past 6 to 9 months, and I'd say they're really coming in 2 flavors. The first is where -- one of the ones that you're referring to, is where we've connected with some of the leading order management systems, Aladdin, Bloomberg and SimCorp. Many of our mutual clients already have signed up, and many are in the process of signing up. So we've got a very high success rate where we've got common clients. 
The other thing that is doing for us is it's opening doors for other conversations where we see our clients able to gain efficiencies because of this. So I think it's got -- right now, the benefits that we're seeing is it's initiating discussions, opening doors and giving us more opportunities to bid on new business. And secondly, it's strengthening the relationships with the businesses that we've already got. Because it is integrated, it is single sign-on, the client is able to look down into their custody activity near real time. It's the -- I think there's the real benefits to our clients that are paying off. 
And I mentioned that there were really -- as we think through the partnerships, they're really coming in 2 flavors. The other type is everything that we are doing with fintechs. And so we've announced quite a few. Just this week, we announced one, where we're working with a fintech to provide independent alternative NAVs for funds. So this provides both an oversight function as well as -- and it enhances the control. And in addition, it serves as a contingency if there were a problem in construction of the NAV. So we've partnered with them. So some of our clients have actually looked to use them, but they found the implementation would have been too difficult. And so by partnering with them, implementing, we gain scale from doing that as well as providing it as a service rather than just as a piece of software. So we're pretty excited. That's already attracted quite a bit of attention this week.",neutral,0.2975,0.021,0.6815

I don't believe we've disclosed total number of apps that we've got, but we've obviously got a pretty careful inventory of those apps. And part of what we're doing in our resiliency build-out in infrastructure investment is also making ourselves more efficient by really the sunsetting of some of those applications.

So I can't really get into the specifics of where those apps are in terms of web-based.",negative,0.0142,0.9329,0.0529
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I'm not -- I think that I'm not sure that's the right way to think about it. Not all modern apps are web-based apps. But I think you should assume that many of the tools that our folks are using are continued -- are always getting better and we're always investing in those. And that gets -- we have -- every weekend of the year, there's something that's being rolled out across our product suite to either internal folks or external folks, and that improves the way they work, so I think that...",neutral,0.2336,0.0132,0.7532
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. In terms of productivity tools, we are rolling out the most -- the office -- I mean the cloud version as Microsoft Office 365. And one of the things that we're also doing is our operations -- we get over 1 million client e-mail inquiries each year. And we are developing AI around making that much more productive and responsive in responding to it. So we're continuing to invest a lot in productivity, and the infrastructure build that we have -- that we're making, I think, will help us do that as well.",neutral,0.3134,0.0112,0.6754
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"And then just one follow-up. So just generally speaking, you said you're spending more in technology. What was that, $3 billion going up to what number? I'm not sure if you said that, if you are willing to do so. And where -- when do you think that turns? Like if you -- if we think of it going down the J-curve, when do you come up the other side with these investments? Is that like a year or 3 years or 5 years?",neutral,0.0362,0.0402,0.9237
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Let me make one comment and Mike might get you more of the details. As we've really picked up the tech spend over the past 3 years, I would say the rate has come down slightly, although the total amount continues to go up because it's now a little bit of a bigger base. But the rate of growth has probably come down. I don't know, Mike, if you want to simulate the J-curve is, meaning think through how quickly we amortize infrastructure...",negative,0.0623,0.7466,0.191
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, I mean look, Mike, I think the way we think about the tech spend is it's not a we're shooting to spend a certain number. What we're doing each year is looking at how much can we actually execute, what are the business cases, how do we think about like the return we're going to get on them and, most importantly, like can we successfully sort of execute it and do we have people in place to do it. And I think that's driving -- and that's going to be the constraint that we've got in most years, is making sure that we can execute it well. 
And I think right now, we feel it's important to continue to make those investments because that's what's going to differentiate us going forward. And keeping in mind that we've got to deliver bottom line -- on bottom line as well, and so we're trying to find the balance there to make sure that we're doing the right thing by all of our stakeholders. And so that's the way we sort of go about how much we're going to spend in any given year.",neutral,0.1186,0.0159,0.8655
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. So the -- so it's a really good plan. So as we look out to next year, I don't want to predict this. If there's not an ROI on the spend, we'll bring it down. But right now, we believe there is.",negative,0.0694,0.484,0.4466
