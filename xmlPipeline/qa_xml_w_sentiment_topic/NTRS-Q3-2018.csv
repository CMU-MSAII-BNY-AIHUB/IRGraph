0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.,neutral,0.0621,0.0175,0.9204
41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Biff, so my first question, just on the C&IS, I guess the assets and then the fund administration and investment management revenues. Like when I look sequentially, it just seems like when we look at the market trends, whether it's end of period, average and lag, it still seems like the growth rates, there's something else that's off. And I understand the FX, too, but when we look at the markets, we usually include those in the market returns. So I'm just trying to understand, on a sequential basis, like was there anything else that was impacting the growth rate, both in the custody and fund administration and investment management? Because both came in lighter relative to sort of the market expectations.",neutral,0.0415,0.1232,0.8353
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So let me walk you through. There was a sequential decline, as you pointed out, and I'll try to add color to that. If we look, we were down about $11 million sequentially. About half of that, about $6 million of that was securities lending fees, which have, as you know, some sequential between the second and third quarter, some seasonality. That was driven, really, by lower volumes, lower borrower demand, particularly in global equities. And the spreads tightened as we saw versus LIBOR in that. Then you get to investment management fees. They were also down sequentially about $4 million -- a little over $4 million. About half of that decline was driven by what I would say there were some outflows and modest repricing captured in that line. So that drove some of that, along with we had a -- about half of that $4 million was from a net-to-gross true-up in the second quarter, so a couple million dollars from that, that we  -- when we lap it sequentially, it creates some of the variance. And then you get to the custody and fund administration fees and the growth rate there or lack of growth rate there. There was some currency translation, as you put out. But I think it's important to remember that transaction volumes are also a factor in this line item. And somewhere between 20% to 25% of our C&IS custody and fund administration fees are really driven by transaction volumes. They're not driven by market levels. So that was an important driver in the decline there. As it relates to growth in the business or organic growth in the business, I'd like to bring this point out. I think that when we look at organic growth in our businesses, we like to look at it on a year-to-date or over longer periods of time. And when we look at where we are through 3 quarters of this year, we're in the range that we've discussed with you around the organic growth rates in our businesses, and we talked about that being in the 4% to 5% range as a firm. We're in that year-to-date. In quarter, in any given quarter, we could be slightly lower than that. In this quarter, we were slightly lower than that, and particularly, in the C&IS business, we were below their trend rates. That being said, as we look out into the fourth quarter, where we have known new business implementations both in our pipeline and known new business implementations, we still feel very good about getting to that historical organic growth rate that we've talked to you about. In any given quarter, that could potentially drive the fees going directionally a different way. But we feel good about what we know in the fourth quarter. Some implementations, particularly in the C&IS business, can be pushed from quarter to quarter, and that can cause a little bit of fluctuation in any one given quarter. But we still, like I said, feel good about the year's view of the organic growth rate in both of our businesses, quite frankly.",negative,0.0437,0.5667,0.3896
41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Okay. And then just a follow-up. Just on the net interest revenue, you mentioned the $17 million, I think, that was included as a headwind given the swap activity. I guess just when we think about going forward, any way to think about like how much of that activity will continue? 
And then given the reduction that you saw on the deposit side, your comments on the growth organically, just any kind of outlook in terms of how we should be thinking about the balance sheet going forward.",neutral,0.1301,0.3104,0.5595
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Okay. So a couple of questions in there, right? I've got a balance sheet question and then the FX trade. So let me -- on the FX trade, as we pointed out, it was $19 million of additional FX in the quarter but with a $17 million net interest income give-up in the quarter. One of the ways to look at this is the...",neutral,0.0901,0.1145,0.7953
34,Mark M. Bette,,3-month cross currency. The U.S. dollar-euro swap is one that you can look at because euro is an area where we have been doing these trades during this quarter.,neutral,0.0919,0.0189,0.8892
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So if you go on to Bloomberg, you can look at that and pull that up, and if that spread narrows, that trade becomes -- there's more NII give-up and less FX spread over that. So that's one way on that line item. We will continue to look at that and determine if it's in the best interest of our shareholders to leave that trade on or not, and we just have to look at market trends and where we are. So far, in the quarter, that trade, particularly euros versus dollars, is still profitable for our shareholders, and that's what we'd see if you looked at it on the Bloomberg terminal.",neutral,0.1129,0.0281,0.8589
34,Mark M. Bette,,"And that's something, Mike, that we'll look to give an update on as we get later into the quarter and we have an opportunity.",neutral,0.2297,0.0104,0.7599
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"In terms of the second part of your question, which is probably getting to what others would say around the balance sheet. What I would say on the balance sheet is this. We certainly continue to monitor the noninterest-bearing deposits and have regular dialogues with our clients. You saw the $2 billion or so that came off of our balance sheet in noninterest-bearing deposits in the quarter. We provide them with a number of solutions for their liquidity needs, whether that's on-balance sheet, off-balance sheet, et cetera. As far as the declines we saw this quarter on that $2 billion, about 40% of that decline was within the category that we've discussed before here, which represents mainly from our fund services business. And these would be asset managers and hedge funds, et cetera. This is also the category that we saw the most declines in when you think back to the second quarter and third quarter of 2017. What we do believe is that most of what remains within that category is now just under $5 billion -- which is now just under $5 billion, is that there is -- they're there for day-to-day operational needs, that we are actually seeing the interest rate sensitivity in that bucket. Most of those clients, we think the balances that stay with us are there for operational needs, so i.e. we have seen much of the rundown in that bucket that we think we would see. If you look at the remainder of where that $2 billion went, the other part of the $2 billion was split, really, between 2 categories. The first was what I would say is our global institutional asset servicing business or kind of BAU custody business. And I think those deposits can ebb and flow from a quarter-to-quarter basis, depending on our clients' cash and capital deployments. They're just putting it to work as a part of their regular BAU, business-as-usual, dealings. We see this kind of fluctuation on a regular basis. And then the last portion of that $2 billion was really more around our treasury management or commercial DDA-type accounts. And that's quite transactional in nature. And so we can see that kind of volatility to that was a little bit more pronounced than we would normally see, but it was a little bit more in the commercial DDA bucket.",neutral,0.054,0.2599,0.6861
0,Operator,,We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,neutral,0.0358,0.0298,0.9343
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"On the outflows, I guess the bigger question is, is that -- it's really tough to just game -- just the size of the balance sheet moving forward. And I guess I want to just ask you, underneath all that, do you still see or expect to see deposit growth from core customers as the business grows? Or are we still at the point where we're just going to be sun-setting the proportion, the noninterest-bearing directionally, and we might not see the overall balance sheet grow that much from here? How do you guys think about that big picture?",neutral,0.1008,0.0358,0.8634
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes, we do, Ken. We think we will still get that growth from the core custody business, and we do a lot of modeling around that as we need to do to understand, for instance, our liquidity coverage ratio and others. But there's significant correlation between our growth in AUC and other things that absolutely drive the balance sheet larger, but we've got to continue to grow the core business. But we do believe that the balance sheet will grow from core asset servicing wins over time. There could be some bumpiness in that as we look at the balance sheet and it seeks certain yield. But I think over long periods of time, if we continue to grow the franchise with the organic growth rates we've talked about here, we will see the balance sheet respond with that type of growth as well.",positive,0.6221,0.0125,0.3654
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. And then within the buckets, can you just talk about just deposit pricing? Interesting, we saw not unexpected faster deposit pricing, at least in terms of the rates paid sequentially, even with some of the declines shown in the savings money and other. So can you just talk to us about the trajectory there and split it across the businesses like you've done in the past? Where have you gotten to in terms of those betas? And how are deposits continuing to act in that regard?",neutral,0.0696,0.0361,0.8943
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes, sure. I'll start off by saying I think we have a very disciplined process when it comes to our deposit pricing, but we've got to be competitive. So if I look at deposit betas, I'd offer you some of the following color. It's a little difficult to just look at 1 quarter, but I'm going to try to break this apart for you because -- I'm sorry, if we look at just 1 quarter, we can have catch-ups, and I think you need to look at the deposit betas over a longer period of time, perhaps, looking at it on a couple of quarters or a year. So if you look at our betas over the last couple of quarters, here's what I would say. For the U.S. dollar portion of our non-U.S. office deposits, we're probably between a 65% and a 75% beta. The vast majority of these deposits, as you know, are institutional-type deposits. Roughly 55% of our non-U.S. deposits are U.S. dollar, and there's also some wholesale deposits within that mix. If you look at the savings, money market and other line or think of that as largely our Wealth Management deposits, or a portion of them, we are probably in the 50% to 60% range for betas over the last couple of quarters in aggregate. I think that line includes our retail Wealth Management deposits, as I just said, which are a little bit below that range. But there's also some institutional deposits in this savings, money market and other line, which are above that range, which brings the blend somewhere into that 50% to 60% range. And then I'd just add that we continue to monitor what money funds and other alternatives bring in terms of the viability of those inside and the competitiveness of those as we think about the betas going forward. So hopefully, that's enough color.",neutral,0.0644,0.0336,0.902
34,Mark M. Bette,,"And then, Ken, I think you had also asked about the decline that we saw in savings, money market and other. And within that bucket, about 75% of that is Wealth Management deposits. And that is where we saw declines during this quarter, was on the Wealth Management side. And we did see, of that, about half of that would have moved into off-balance sheet funds. And then what's left would kind of split between whether there was deployment from clients, whether it was investments or debt pay-downs. And then there were some that we would have seen of that other bucket that would have just left our balance sheet or the balances were pulled down by clients.",negative,0.0224,0.7309,0.2467
0,Operator,,We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0386,0.0333,0.9281
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Actually, I just want to follow up on that last comment. I believe, Mark, that you made about the proportion of the decline in the noninterest-bearers rolling onto the balance sheet. Given those dynamics, does that result in a bit of a catch-up on the deposit cost when you see those Wealth Management clients roll into interest-bearing? And can that put some temporary upward pressure on what would look like a single-quarter beta, which I think, Biff, you referenced earlier?",negative,0.148,0.6244,0.2276
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Yes. One thing I would say, Brennan. So the decline that we saw in Wealth Management deposits, the noninterest part of Wealth Management deposits was actually pretty stable for the quarter. The decline that we saw was in the interest-bearing side for the Wealth Management deposits.",negative,0.1365,0.7122,0.1513
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"It was already in there. But Brennan, to the larger point you brought up there, that's why I tried to say, in any given quarter, the betas can look large if there's catch-up from either being slightly lagging market and disciplined -- and we really do try to look at them over a year or some longer period of time to understand how the beta has actually moved. In any given quarter, there could be pricing catch-up. Sometimes, there can be pricing slowdowns if we got ahead in any quarters. This quarter would look like more like pricing catch-up in some of the lines.",neutral,0.0765,0.1737,0.7498
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay, that's really helpful. And then when we think about the transactional volumes, which you referenced having an impact on the C&IS rate, so to speak, the way we kind of have to model it from the outside, was that transactional weakness fairly consistent through the quarter? Or was September particularly weak? And then I'm guessing, when you think about fourth quarter, given your comments about looking at the pipeline and your outlook and an expectation of rebound, that would suggest that fourth quarter volumes look like a return to a more normal pace. Is that fair?",neutral,0.2439,0.3,0.4561
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. They were slower in the early part of the quarter and certainly slowest in August, with some pick up a little bit in September, particularly as we got near the end of September. And I don't have the numbers through October. We'll give you some color on that in December. But I would say the earlier quarter was the slower periods from transactions.",negative,0.0266,0.8897,0.0837
0,Operator,,We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0388,0.0308,0.9304
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Not to beat the dead horse on the deposit beta, but maybe just coming at it from 1 different angle on the noninterest-bearing side. Just looking at the last tightening cycle in '04, '06, and I appreciate the company is structured a little bit different, but just looking at noninterest-bearing versus total deposits, I think that came down from something like 20% or 21% at the start of that cycle down to about 11% to 12% by the end of the cycle. This cycle, so far, you're starting in at around 28%, and now you're down to about 21%. So just -- and again, that's the noninterest-bearing deposits divided by the total deposits. I just wanted to understand the nature of the structural difference and in thinking about that bucket going forward from here. Sorry if I missed the breakout of the total balance between Wealth Management and C&IS, but if you could bifurcate that just so we could understand maybe some of the risks to that on, at least, the Wealth side. And of course, you mentioned money market products being another substitute. How do you view clients switching into those types of products?",neutral,0.058,0.1351,0.8069
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Okay. Here's what I'd say. I think we have a fairly significant different business mix between 2004 and 2006 when you look at the construct of the balance sheet. There are more institutional, large institutional Asset Management-type clients that exist on the balance sheet for that period of time. So that measure you have of it moving from 20% to, let's call, 12% over that period of time may not necessarily translate to now because the mix of clients on the balance sheet could be fairly meaningfully different. We did our largest acquisition in the GFS space in 2005, and it's moved to be a much different proportionality of our business. If I look at that mix though of the $19 billion, the second part of your question, was sort of how is that $19 billion mix today. First, let me start off, about 90% of that is in dollars. Just under 90% of it's in dollars, about 87%. And then about 30% of that is in Wealth Management deposits. 20% is what I'd say are in support of our treasury cash management business. And then the remaining 50% is really attributable to what I just described, the C&IS business. Some core and some supporting asset managers in there. So that's kind of the breakdown of that $19 billion to $20 billion. But I wouldn't want to presuppose that it moves back down to 11% or 12% as a percent of the balance sheet because our mix is different. I don't have that answer, but I think that you can make that assumption correctly given the different business mix for the company. And that need for that cash to be there to support large asset managers' activities.",neutral,0.0491,0.0853,0.8656
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Right, right. That's super helpful. And then just to follow up, I guess, just on the expense side. How should we think about your target on that expense to trust fee ratio and bringing that down? How should we think about that behaving if we have more pressure on the equity markets that would obviously reduce the denominator of that? Or do you feel that you can be responsive on the expense side to downturns in market-based fees? Or should we just think of that as sort of a natural outcome of any pressure in the market that, that expense to trust fee ratio may drift back up?",neutral,0.1675,0.2278,0.6047
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"So I would say -- let me give you a longer-term view first, is we absolutely think that we can continue to drive that lower with things like Value for Spend and a lot of initiatives that we have going on. In the short term, to be able to react to market volatility or down drafts in the market in any given quarter, that may be difficult. Remember that some proportionality of our expenses are going to move with that same market decline. So they move directionally with that, so we get that benefit. But there are others that are more fixed or not directly tied to that market level, and we're getting after those. We think though over quarters that we can have an expense discipline that's more closely aligned with the revenue fees that we're seeing. That's why I would just add that we talk on these calls a lot about continuing to do what we can to drive the organic fee leverage into our business, meaning the things that we can most control are how fast we grow it organically and how much expense we need to support that growth. And as long as we get those in line with some leverage, the markets over long periods of time will likely be upward sloping and be our friend. So hopefully, that answers your question.",neutral,0.1908,0.0182,0.791
0,Operator,,We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0384,0.0283,0.9333
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So maybe just to wrap up the NIR conversation, a couple of things I wanted to follow up on. I guess, one, I think in the past, you talked about just the overall size of noninterest-bearing deposit. What you guys consider sort of at risk or runoff, I think, was in about $5 billion to $6 billion range. And now, Biff, you gave us a bunch of comp breakdown by bucket, and that was helpful. But is the total $5 billion to $6 billion still the right number? So you kind of said, look, $2 billion left, so we're still dealing with like maybe $4-ish billion or so at risk? Is that sort of the right framework still? Or is the $5 billion to $6 billion maybe a high number? That's part one, and then I have a quick follow-up on the deposit beta. I'll just ask that after.",neutral,0.0543,0.0405,0.9052
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Alex, I think that, that number is actually smaller than $5 billion to $6 billion now. I think that where the rate moves we've seen with, what, 8 hikes I think we had now, we actually think that the rate sensitive money in there has probably already -- in our discussions with that pool, we think that the rate sensitive portions of that have started to move or have already moved. I should say have already moved. So it's smaller. It's not 0. I should be clear. But I think it's smaller than the $5 billion to $6 billion we talked about, so I think we're seeing some of that rate sensitivity money already have taken action. So I would size that a little smaller than that. I can't give you the exact number because -- but we -- I think we've seen a lot of that action. Some of what you saw in this quarter is I tried to described earlier. There was some that moved from that bucket. I think we said about 40%. So I think that part. The others, I would say, was more what I'd say BAU kind of moves that we can see from the normal transactional volume. It can leave and come in any given quarter. So that -- hopefully, that helps a little bit more color.",neutral,0.0752,0.0973,0.8275
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Yes. No, that's helpful. And then with respect to  deposit betas, so I know you guys said, I think, like 55% or 60% deposit betas, and I wasn't sure if you're talking about kind of over the course of the year. Because if I look at Q3, it seems a bit higher than that, especially when you consider a portion of deposits outside the U.S. So was there any particular catch-up? I know you said occasionally there might be 1 or 2, was there an outsized catch-up in deposit pricing this quarter. So again, kind of looking at it to Q4, perhaps we're not going to see as big of a move?",neutral,0.0958,0.0447,0.8595
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"I think it would be fair to assume that the outsized or the larger beta that you saw in the quarter would have some competitive catch-up in it, where we have to evaluate where we are and we may have had the benefit in Q2 and we have to assess where we are on the competitive landscape. We get some of that data at end of quarters, as you may know, from others, and that provides us with the opportunity to price competitively. So that's the assumption and we'll let you go from there.",neutral,0.2147,0.0133,0.7719
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Yes. That's what it sounded like. All right. Last one. Promise. So you said that you guys made some pricing adjustments in C&IS in the investment management side. Can you expand on that? I know it sounded like there was maybe a little bit of a drag on investment management fees in C&IS this quarter. And then just bigger picture, when you guys talking about 4% to 5% organic growth over time, obviously not quarter-to-quarter but kind of on an annual basis maybe, you guys are thinking about it in terms of organic fee growth, correct? Not organic asset growth? Just taking into account any sort of price degradation we might see?",neutral,0.0544,0.0427,0.903

And as you know, the competitive nature of that is very much in the press, and we're not immune to that either. And we have important clients, and we have dialogues with them on a regular basis around their pricing, and we have some of that in the period.

It feels like part of the industry your serving is under pressure. How is that translating into pressure on the fee rates you can generate there?,neutral,0.0422,0.174,0.7838
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Geoff, it certainly continues to remain competitive in that space, and it really has more nuance than just for me to just say that broad brush. In certain markets, we could see very highly competitive pricing, parts of Asia or we could see it in other parts of the world. In other parts where we see what I would say is more measured and pragmatic pricing, so I'm hesitant to give you anything other than it's a really competitive landscape for pricing. We feel pretty good about our ability to complete and still drive margins. We talked about the margins in our C&IS business continued to expand in the quarter, so they're able to win without margin erosion in that space. So we feel pretty good. But it is still a very competitive landscape in that space. I do think in the macro environment, we are able -- if you can bring value proposition, you can still get paid for it in the space. But you have to demonstrate the value you're creating for the marketplace in which we compete, particularly in the institutional side of the business, which is what I think you were referencing.

I can't guarantee that they'd come back. They could have been excess cash. But we're tracking at a client level, I know, have we seen these types of moves before from those individual clients?

So when a pension fund board or a public fund board is evaluating how their assets have performed and their managers have performed, we provide very detailed analytics. And that's another way for us to use the data we have and work with them to provide what I'd call very high value-added services.

So really, those -- it's solutions for our asset owners and asset managers. It's really -- that I would say is more in the security commissions and trading space than it would be in the -- within the trust fee categories. And we have seen good growth in that area. I would say that for this quarter, the security commissions and trading performance was impacted by transition management activity being lower and as well as interest rate swap activity being lower, and those do tend to be more volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Biff, just a quick question on the comp expense. I want to make sure that the third quarter is a good jumping-off point when we think about where we're going in the fourth quarter. I think you mentioned that there was some impact on incentive comps in the quarter from previous quarters. Was there an accrual reversal in the quarter? Or was this the number that you posted a clean number to think about for fourth quarter?",neutral,0.2072,0.2109,0.5819
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Brian, it's Mark. Yes, I would say that it's a fairly clean number. I mean, the decline that we would have had for the equity incentive compensation really relates to when we issue the grants in the first quarter for retirement eligible expense that gets recognized over the first 2 quarters. Most of it on the first, and then $11 million of it was in the second quarter. So that would have rolled off in the third quarter. So what's left, I would say, is a pretty -- probably good, solid starting point as far as compensation goes.",positive,0.6246,0.1338,0.2416

And then on the outside services, I mean, I thought it was about a year ago, you mentioned there was some ability to maybe manage that number down, but it seems they just keep going up. How are you thinking about that going forward? And is there an opportunity to manage those expenses lower in '19 or '20?",neutral,0.1589,0.1391,0.702
34,Mark M. Bette,,"I would say when we look at the year-over-year growth in outside services, we're looking at about 6% to 7%. There is -- probably about 3 points of that would've been from the acquisition. And then when you look at what's left, about 3% of growth, there is the impact of the higher third-party adviser fees for revenue recognition; and that the gross accounting, slightly offset by lower sub-adviser cost. But we would say that you're probably looking at -- when you adjust for those things, a pretty modest amount of gross really driven by technical services, which includes market data but offset by we are seeing lower consulting and legal expense on a year-over-year basis. So that's outside services on a year-over-year basis.",neutral,0.2116,0.1752,0.6131
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. And I'll add one piece to that, too. There can be -- you've seen some improvement, I think, in the trajectory of the compensation line in some cases where we've chosen to outsource the outside service line picks up the expense, but the comp line should come down commensurately. So we have some -- we've talked about some of our managed services around our technology that we've done. That's another underlying driver of that as well.",neutral,0.3773,0.0331,0.5896

And we would look at our expense to be in the 5% to 5.5% range, excluding all of those items, too. That's not organic. That's just sort of at the core if we pull all those things out.

11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Got it. Okay. And then maybe the final one, just to tie it all together on net interest income. I heard the whole thing about each of the pieces, but I'm sure people look at it as balance sheet didn't grow much, NIM was down a basis point sequentially, we had the mix shift issues and the deposit beta issues. When you put it all together, it sounds like net interest income would never grow no matter what rates do and what customer balances do. But doesn't make sense. Meaning as your business grows, as customers grows, as you win new business can -- the question I have is do you have a ballpark idea of range of what you think over a year's period of time what -- if your organic growth is 4% or 5%, what net interest income should accompany with it over time?",neutral,0.0361,0.118,0.8459
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. I won't give that range, but I will say this, we absolutely think that the NIM can expand and the balance sheet can grow and the NIM can expand as long as we continue to see the deposit betas move sort of at where we're seeing industry levels. And again, not just looking at 1 quarter, but looking at trends in the deposit betas, we think it can expand, and we think the balance sheet can get bigger with the organic growth trajectory that we talked about before. This quarter had some movement in it. We had mix shift in the balance sheet. We had some runoff of the noninterest-bearing deposits. But we absolutely think that it can expand, particularly if you think rates are going to rise in that environment. The value of the noninterest-bearing deposits that exist on our balance sheet are even greater in terms of expansiveness of that NIM. So we do believe that. It's just this quarter, it kind of flattened out. I think you need to look at the trajectory of our NIM and its migration more than just 1 quarter. I know you -- that's what you do.

Two would be you're looking for organic fee growth in the 4% to 5% range, as you said.

So if you look at the actual core business, it's still up. Seasonality and then one pricing decision that you make is what basically brings your core down a couple of million dollars.

We've got some noise in trading that's from quarter-to-quarter. So if I back through this, instead of seeing a decline of something like $25 million to $27 million in revenue, you really have core revenues that are up, and then you've got seasonality hitting a couple of spots, you've got a price -- one pricing decision, and you got some noise in other. So when you start looking at it that way and say, well, year-over-year, we're still growing revenues 10%. In this particular quarter, it's just got a litany of things that once you start looking at it cause everything to kind of round to the -- for the negative, which is what I'm hearing you in your conversation trying to say, but the noise really covers that up this particular quarter.

We look at our expected duration of the litigation. We look at the conversion ratio of our B shares to A shares. And that's driven, in many cases, by any contributions made to settlement funds. So all of those can, in any given quarter, be valued and come out. The Visa stock price has moved. Our thinking around the duration of the litigation can change in any given period, and all of those ended up being a quite significant move this quarter. The -- you can calculate it. It's in our Q.

What do you -- especially with balance sheet growth being slower, do you accelerate your buybacks even more significantly over time?",positive,0.5213,0.0385,0.4401
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So the drivers of that in this quarter were really a decline in the risk-weighted assets. And as we said earlier, our total payout ratio in the quarter was a little bit north of 100. So we didn't really add anything to the equity portion, but we did have lower risk-weighted assets in the quarter. The drivers of that lower risk-weighted assets were lower foreign exchange exposures, lower securities lending exposures, lower what I will call other. And we can have things like client settlement, securities, client overdrafts and others. All of those quite frankly kind of went in our favor at period-end and they helped drive the risk-weighted asset out down, which drove the CET1 up about 50 basis points. So that was the driver in the quarter. Those can have some end-of-period volatility to them. 
The second part of your question was really more around the how do we think about that. Look, we increased our dividend 31% in -- starting in the third quarter, and we bought or we were approved -- excuse me, we were not objected to by the Federal Reserve to buy up to $1 billion worth of stock in the quarter. We executed on that in this quarter, as you can see from the buyback. And we continue to look at that. We will look at that in our evaluation with our Board and others in coming quarters and in the spirit of the next year's CCAR and capital ask with the Board to see what the right return levels of capital are.

And so when we do our stress testing, we want to make sure that we have the dividend payout ratio that can sustain itself in stress when the earnings and other things are in stress. We have, I think publicly said, that we think being in that 30% to 40% range from a dividend payout ratio is an area where we feel comfortable with that over time, and we'll continue to evaluate that.
