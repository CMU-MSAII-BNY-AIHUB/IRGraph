0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0439,0.0177,0.9384
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Welcome, Emily. So first question for you guys, I was hoping to go back to opening comments around how the challenging rate backdrop and, obviously, market was challenging in the beginning of the year, perhaps masking some of the growth initiatives that are taking place underneath. It sounds like, Todd, you're a little bit more optimistic about that into next year. So can you help us contextualize which specific initiatives from a top line perspective you expect to be the most material contributors to sort of top line growth into '21? And over time, again, given numerous things you mentioned, what do you see the reasonable organic fee growth for the firm, excluding sort of the market dynamics?",neutral,0.1225,0.0131,0.8644
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Sure, Alex. Good to hear from you. I think probably the most impactful one is around Pershing. And so -- and we did call out the details around Pershing. So as we've been investing in the advisory space, and we are seeing some good growth and some good wins there, yes, we saw on a year-over-year basis a decline in fees. But there's about $73 million of fee waivers that are reflected there. So if you adjust for that, there was actually pretty healthy growth. So we continue to see that as a potential upside. And it will be good to get these fee waivers behind us because that -- the masking of what's lying underneath it will go away. I think secondly, in Asset Servicing, we're seeing the same effect, where we're starting to see a little bit of fee waivers. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of net interest income impact and there's a little bit of other noise. 
I mean we had divested off an asset that was driving that fee line a year ago. We took a big gain in the fourth quarter, but there was some income related to that, that we would have enjoyed in the third quarter that's no longer there. But when we look at what we see going on there, we do see some traction around our data and analytics space. We -- I mean -- and also one of the important things there, and one of our key strategies, is quality of service. And the quality of our service and the feedback that we're getting from clients continues to improve. It helps not only the retention of business but new business, especially with existing clients, and we're starting to see that come through the line and a bit of that is masked. 
On the Clearing and Collateral Management space we're making significant investments in what we're calling the future of collateral, which will make that business much more interoperable and beneficial to our clients, we see some growth opportunities. This particular quarter was pretty soft for that. I mean it had -- again, we had divested off an asset that was reflected in that line. We also -- and this is kind of surprising, just the clearing of volumes in the treasury market despite the massive increases in issuance by the U.S. government, they were down. 
It was kind of a quiet quarter when it came to the Clearing and Collateral Management business and the clearing business, in particular. We saw a very modest increase in global collateral but domestic collateral management was down a little bit as we saw some deleveraging. So there are a number of things masking that. I think we'll be able to pick up market share in the future. And I think we'll also be able to pick up a movement from bilateral to tri-party because of the efficiencies that they're going to get on our platform. So I think those are a couple of the key points.",positive,0.49,0.0953,0.4148
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. And I guess just putting it all together and not to pinpoint, '21 or '22, as you think about the collection of businesses that you guys have, what do you think is the reasonable organic fee growth that we should anticipate from BNY Mellon over time?",neutral,0.1226,0.0108,0.8666
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I don't think I want to put that out of the guidance at this point. But when we look to this year, there's a modest amount, 1% or 2% underlying kind of organic fee growth, a lot of it masked by all those things I just described.",neutral,0.0897,0.0428,0.8676
0,Operator,,We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0335,0.0282,0.9383
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Todd, you mentioned the buyback when the gates are lifted from the Fed. And I just wanted to understand how quickly you would be willing to buy back the stock down to the Tier 1 leverage ratio of, what, I think, it's 6% that you're using as you were self-imposed minimum there?",neutral,0.056,0.0402,0.9038
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Well, first of all, we'd like to get started, obviously, as soon as we can. The guidance that Emily gave is as a target. And right now, our constraint is the Tier 1 leverage ratio, as we go through the stress test, that's historically what it's been. And we gave guidance that we think we should target somewhere between the 5.5% and 6% range, and we're currently at 6.5% and growing. 
That being said, the reason we give guidance in that range is right now, our -- as you know, our balance sheets have been bloated because of all of the liquidity that the Fed has put in place. So in this kind of environment where we've already felt the sharp increase in deposits that come with the market environment, we wouldn't expect another course of that. So we'd probably be willing to move towards the middle or lower end of that target. 
So that being said, we'll have to look at market conditions at the time when the Fed will lift the restrictions, see what the economy is doing, what we think is going to be going on with the balance sheet and we'd absolutely be willing to start moving aggressively.",neutral,0.1604,0.0545,0.7851
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. So if there was another fiscal plan that came through that doesn't really impact your deposits, obviously, as much as the Fed increasing the size of the balance sheet, so another round of fiscal stimulus doesn't really drive up your deposits. You don't have to worry about that too much. Is that one of the takeaways there?",neutral,0.1321,0.0916,0.7763
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,I think that's right.,neutral,0.1397,0.0276,0.8328
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. Okay. And then on the follow-up question just on how we're thinking about reinvesting the cash you have on the balance sheet. Maybe Emily you can speak to how you're thinking about redeploying that into securities. You talked about having NIM next year, or I should say NII next year will be running at a little bit less than the 4Q run rate. So I'm expecting that some of that cash redeployment will be occurring. Maybe if you could give us some color as to how you're thinking about that, the pace and how much of your cash you're willing to redeploy into securities?",neutral,0.0759,0.019,0.905
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. Good to hear from you, Betsy. Ultimately, as we've been talking about for some time, we have been looking to redeploy the excess cash that we have. And of course, as deposits do begin to season, we have an ability to do that. We have been increasing the amount of high-quality non-HQLA in the portfolio marginally quarter-on-quarter and actually year-over-year, that's up about 29 -- that's up about $10 billion, sorry. And -- so it's a mixture of growing the portfolio, investing in -- growing the non-HQLA around the edges, extending duration. And the only other thing I would say is we -- it's not just about the securities portfolio, but it's also about the loan portfolio. So we are redeploying some of our deposits into our loan portfolio, which, of course, also helps with client services and client relationships.",neutral,0.3346,0.0181,0.6473
0,Operator,,We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.,neutral,0.0374,0.0229,0.9396
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Just a follow-up on the capital. And Todd, we've talked about this a little bit in the past. But I get it, you got tons and you keep making more and the buyback is awfully enticing and accretive. I'm curious on how you guys balance that with the potential to deploy capital into something else that could accelerate growth and/or improve the overall mix of the company?",neutral,0.3537,0.0122,0.6342
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Okay. Glenn, yes, thanks for the question. We're constantly looking at what opportunities lie out there for us. And we take -- and what I say, Glenn, is we take a very, very careful look at it, and I think a very disciplined approach to how we would look at something inorganic. We're certainly not opposed to it. From time to time, we see certain types of actions that lift-outs that might make some sense to us. 
But frankly, we compare them to a capital return. And they should be able to beat the long-term EPS growth that we'd otherwise get buying back our shares. So we hold ourselves very strictly to that discipline. There may be -- and we did things through the financial crisis. There may be opportunities here to do something. We've got a team that's constantly evaluating, whether it's in the fintech space, whether it's extending a market, whether it's doing something in adjacency to what we're currently looking at. So we're absolutely willing to consider things, but they have to make sense for the long-term growth of the company.",neutral,0.2567,0.0132,0.7301
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe just one quickie on issuer services. We -- I know it's hard with the crystal ball, but we've had a big surge in debt issuance this year. I'm curious on how you think about just the overall business growth going into next year? What you see as pulled forward versus just a still good issuing environment?",neutral,0.1984,0.0183,0.7833
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Sure. So in our issuer services, we've actually got 2 businesses in that segment. We've got the Corporate Trust business, which you're referring to, but we also have the DR, the Depositary Receipt business. The DR business was -- as you might expect, was quite a bit softer. A lot of that is international -- related to international equities, obviously. And the volume and dividends and the action there was down. So we generate a lot of revenue off of the corporate actions and the third quarter is typically a pretty good quarter. It was still up sequentially, but it was down substantially year-over-year. So that kind of masks the underlying performance of Corporate Trust. 
We think Corporate Trust continues to -- we've picked up a little bit of market share in some of the core businesses. Frankly, we had lost our mojo a couple of years ago. And I think we've gotten it back, and we're seeing some growth there. And the opportunity and the issuance that has taken place has been significant. It's not the highest yielding type of issuance, but as we start to see some more of the structured product and the credit product come back, we think we're well positioned to capture that growth. There's a little -- this is another one of the businesses that does -- is impacted by fee waivers. So a little bit of that will be masked by fee waivers over the next quarter or 2. 
And that's why in my opening remarks, I said looking forward to getting that reset done, having the fee waivers fully priced into the run rate as well as the lower interest rates in our net interest income, and we expect to see that probably sometime early next year.",negative,0.0903,0.7485,0.1612
0,Operator,,We will take our next question from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.,neutral,0.0381,0.0294,0.9326
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"First, just given the net interest revenue and waiver pressures, just curious if there's any other efficiency initiatives possible to reduce expenses heading into '21 despite some of the investments that you guys have talked about making for the business to drive growth?",positive,0.4908,0.0319,0.4773
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"I'll take that. So yes, we do have many efficiency initiatives that are actually ongoing. And ultimately, whether it is -- I think we've talked at previous -- in previous forums, whether it's investments that we've made in terms of automating client inquiries, hands-free NAV and various other initiatives. Those are all things that are coming. Look, we do expect -- they already are coming through our cost line, the benefit, and they will continue to come through the cost line. 
The other thing I would just say is that in this year we probably -- not probably, we reached our peak of investment in resiliency. That doesn't mean we're going to stop investing. We have -- we will continue to invest in resiliency, but we reached the peak investment. So that will abate a bit and give us some room. And likewise, we have, ultimately, very different initiatives across the business from a structural perspective as we're looking at the potential permanent impact of COVID on real estate footprint as well as sales and marketing expenses and other digitization efforts that are accelerating with our clients.",neutral,0.1867,0.0226,0.7907
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Mike, if I could add to that. One of the things that we did in the quarter is I named Bridget Engle Head of Tech and Ops. She was previously Head of Technology. And by bringing Tech and Ops together, and Ops covers most of the operations of the company, I think the opportunity to automate, to work more closely together, to really target where we're going to invest in our automation process, we still do. There's still lots of fruit on the -- low-lying fruit of that tree because we still do that and we, unfortunately, have a lot of manual processes, things that we can do more efficiently. 
So by putting Tech and Ops together, and Bridget Engle working with our Head of Operations, Ann Fogarty, that much more closely, I think we'll be able to identify and execute more quickly on some of these efficiencies. I mean we've been moving pretty well as basically funded the increase in our -- the significant increase in our technology expenses over the last few years. We do think those increases are going to abate. They're not going to be at the same rate. It's probably been a 10% compounded annual growth rate for a number of years here. And so that puts us in a position to keep grinding through it.",positive,0.5029,0.0202,0.4769
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"All right. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. Just given some of the noise with the waivers and even volatility levels throughout the year, just curious how pricing has been trending in asset servicing over the past 6 or so months. And then just in terms of going forward, any expected changes or any expected kind of surges in contract negotiations that could move it either one way or another.",neutral,0.1548,0.0379,0.8073
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure, Mike, I'll take that. We -- obviously, asset servicing is a pretty mature business. So repricing is just a continual headwind, although it's pretty modest. And we have not seen a change in that -- in the amount, really, from a percentage basis and impact on revenues for several years. So it's not any worse than it has been. As you do rightfully point out, though, it is lumpy. And as bigger contracts do come up for renewal, that can be lumpy.",negative,0.053,0.6917,0.2553
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"But the pipeline is strong. Yes, the pipeline is strong. And when we look at the pipeline, a very high percentage of them now, I think over 20% of it, is looking at our data and analytics offerings. So we're really starting to see that pick up. And when you -- if you look at -- I mean I think the best way to evaluate the business is from the operating margins and the operating margins aren't under pressure because of pricing. They're under pressure because of the cyclical nature of interest rates in that business.",neutral,0.1905,0.0315,0.778
0,Operator,,We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,neutral,0.034,0.0374,0.9286
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"I guess there are some factors you have difficulty controlling and some factors that you can control. You mentioned once interest rates settle down, we'll see some more of the benefits. You guided for lower NII ahead, though. So the first question is when do you think that you'll see the full negative impact of interest rates in the run rate so we can see the underlying progress come through? And then I'll ask a second question.",neutral,0.0785,0.1538,0.7677
19,Emily Hope Portney,,Sure.,neutral,0.1081,0.0177,0.8742
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Go ahead, Emily.",neutral,0.0642,0.0279,0.908
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. Mike, good to hear from you. So look, I'm not going to try to call the market or the timing on the interests and rates. But as we did just guide in our prepared remarks, we think that the fourth quarter NII will probably be anywhere from 3% to 5% down from this quarter. And ultimately, we do think it's probably a pretty good estimate to use slightly lower than what the fourth quarter is meant to be or what we expect it to be to project out the rest of next year.",negative,0.1343,0.5798,0.2859
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"So it -- so basically, we're saying, Mike, that something slightly under the fourth quarter run rate. But that's making the assumption that the forward yield curve is reflected in what actually happens.",neutral,0.0491,0.1131,0.8378
19,Emily Hope Portney,,And just to add to that...,neutral,0.1026,0.0274,0.8699
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,So no improvement in rates. It just reflects where the market is.,neutral,0.0848,0.2114,0.7038
19,Emily Hope Portney,,Exactly.,neutral,0.0505,0.0259,0.9236
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"Okay. There's only so much you can do about that, I guess. But on the other question, assets under custody, you're up 8% year-over-year and your investment servicing revenues are down 4% year-over-year. And this is not a new issue for you or any of the trust banks, but how can you grow the investment servicing business while also growing investment servicing revenues? 
You mentioned, Todd, you've gained share in the trust business, but there seems to be a disconnect between AUC growth and the revenues related to that. Is that just competition? And can you change your fee model or how you charge your customers? It seems like your customers are getting the better end of the arrangement.",negative,0.0217,0.9087,0.0696
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Sometimes it feels that. There's a little bit of noise, Mike, in that line. And in the -- when we look at the asset servicing fees in the corporate line rather than in the segment, that reflects the clearing and collateral management business as well. And the clearing and collateral management business in the third quarter didn't have a very good quarter. There was a divestiture that took place. We've lost a significant amount of revenue there. But the activity was actually pretty depressed in the quarter, which is kind of a surprise because even though the U.S. government is issuing a significant amount of additional treasuries, the actual trading around that was a little bit less than we would have anticipated and there were some other impacts there. 
The other thing in that line is securities lending. And securities lending, again, volumes are up, that's another interest rate and market-related issue. The reinvestment rates are significantly down, so the spreads are down. And we didn't see many things in the way of special. So there is a little bit of the deleveraging. So if you adjust for that, we don't see anything substantially different in the pricing or the operating margins -- underlying operating margins, except for some of the cyclical effects that I just pointed out. 
That being said, it puts us in a position should we price to assume that those cyclical pressures are going to remain forever or should we price maintaining the optionality that we're going to have on the upside. And competition will help us drive that, but we're going to do what we think will be in the long-term interest with those clients.",negative,0.0181,0.9319,0.05
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"Okay. I guess that leads to why you're putting so much effort on the efficiency. I mean we don't have the earnings from investment servicing. You don't break it out to that detail. But we still get -- even after adjusting for securities lending and these other factors, there's still -- AUC is growing faster than the revenues from it, right? And so that's why you're trying to improve efficiency. 
Anything about the earnings related to that business? Is it keeping pace? Because, again, we don't have it at that level, and that's a core function of what you guys do.",neutral,0.1998,0.025,0.7752
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. No, I think we -- it's a meaningful contributor to the overall performance of the company. I think we are continuing to get more efficient. But we also have some other investments that we think that we can expand the revenue stream as we provide more capabilities around data management, for example. We're starting to see a little bit of traction there. 
Some of the applications I described -- I described one on the -- in my earlier remarks, where we've got an ESG app that I think is really starting to gain some traction. We've got 12 clients now operating on it. We've got maybe 100 demos that we've given. Very good take-up on that. We have another app on distribution analytics which, I think, can really help our clients increase their distribution, and there's -- that's how you really build out relationships. 
So there's things that we're trying to generate more revenues as we take on more of the operational burden from our clients. But at the same time, we are -- the throughput is going up without significant increases in cost. So yes, we are driving down our per unit cost meaningfully.",positive,0.7797,0.054,0.1664
0,Operator,,We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0354,0.0357,0.9288
6,Brennan Hawken,,"I just wanted to follow-up on NII. You -- Emily, thank you for providing -- taking a stab at 2021 and appreciate that you're using the forward curve. So just was curious about what assumptions are also embedded for MBS prepayment activity in that? It seems as though more recently that was a bit of a surprise versus some of maybe what the third parties -- third-party data sources had been expecting. Are you expecting that, that will continue to accelerate? 
And then when you talk about the lending and some balance sheet optimization into lending, is that on the margin side -- margin loan side or is that elsewhere? Because it looks like the margin loan yield is holding up better than the prior reserve period. So curious if that's sustainable, is that some mix or some color on that front?",neutral,0.1261,0.0296,0.8443
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. Sure. I'll take both of those. In terms of MBS prepayments, just for what it's worth, they were -- we had a -- they accelerated about 5% more than we originally expected and that is part of the headwind on NIR, at least in the third quarter. In terms of as we think about -- as we go through next year, we do expect it to slow modestly. So that's in our projection. 
And then, I guess, in terms of your question with regard to lending, we actually -- at the minute, our lending portfolio is relatively flat at $55 billion. You'll see probably growth in that as we get into next year, again, more marginally. We don't lead with lending. It's certainly something that we do to strengthen relationships that we have with our clients. And the places where we really see a lot of -- or some opportunity is in the '40 Act lending space, well, basically mortgages in wealth and also supply trade finance in Treasury Services.",neutral,0.2164,0.1402,0.6435
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. And I would add to that, Brennan, that interestingly, in the big drawdowns that we had on the corporate committed facilities, 70% of those have been paid back. So we've seen that loan -- part of the loan portfolio go down. So I think that's kind of the noise associated with that, that's been stabilized. But we would like to continue to grow, and we'll do it prudently. 
The margin lending business. It's a very low risk. It's a decent return. We'd like to see some more '40 Act lending, which is something that looks akin to that as well as the supply chain and mortgages and wealth that we talked about.",neutral,0.2203,0.1499,0.6298
6,Brennan Hawken,,"All right. That's really helpful. Thanks for that color. And then when we think of like taking a step back here, rates are tough and clearly more environmental than something that specifically you guys are doing. But a big part of your economic model is embedded within rates because of the deposit spreads embedded within your -- the returns that you generate from your clients. 
And so this period feels sort of different than when we went into the last one. The last one was viewed as temporary. It's just something we need to get through, and then we're going to come out on the other side and we'll return to a ""normal environment."" And that position has come under a pretty significant question. 
So I guess, what I would say is, what are you -- how are you thinking about making adjustments to the pricing model? How are you thinking about reconsidering some of the economic considerations when you assess clients? And what are your assumptions for where deposit spreads would return to, just to ensure that the new business that you win, the assessment of existing relationships remains reasonably calibrated to what is the likely environment, unfortunately, we're going to be until a while. I know it's a tough one, but just curious your thoughts.",neutral,0.0792,0.0725,0.8483
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. So -- yes, I think that the general feeling and ours is as well is that rates are lower for longer. By the way, the last cycle, they were low for a fairly substantial period of time. That being said, we see the light at the end of the tunnel for the fully baked in impact of interest rates today, and it's from there that we'll grow. 
So we will take into consideration what the market implies in interest rates as we price activity going forward, and that's reflected in all of our pricing assumptions. And we've also got a whole series of initiatives that we think will give us deeper relationships and add revenue streams as we look there out. 
So we do see the potential for some margin expansion. We see the potential for some revenue growth. We see the benefits of our operating efficiencies. It really just points back to our key priorities. There's a handful of organic growth initiatives that we've got in place. They're not all going to pay out, but some of them will. And the activity levels are still high. What we do is important, and it's growing. 
I mean if you look at the Pershing marketplace, the advisory business is growing rapidly. And we think we can capture more of that. There's been a consolidation amongst custodians. That's an interesting opportunity for us. So it's not always with us. We understand we've got an interest rate headwind. We want to get it behind us and move off a bit and grow the company from there.",neutral,0.3875,0.0213,0.5911

7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"First of all, thanks for the extra disclosure on the money market fee waivers and, Emily, on the balance sheet strategy, definitely very helpful. Maybe going into Pershing picking off, starting with that last -- with your last answer, Todd, within that opportunity within the RIA custodian space is -- first of all, I missed one number you've quoted earlier. I don't know if it was the $12 billion of net new assets in that business or if's something different? If you could repeat that? 
And then the question really is, is more of the opportunity going forward on that, I get the time line of it. Are you -- have you benefited from that significantly already? Or do you think that we're in the early innings of the RIA market share gain there? And are you doing anything differently than you had in the past in that business to try to win that business from the other custodian?",neutral,0.1262,0.0214,0.8524
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Your number was correct. And yes, we are investing more significantly in the business. We're investing in both sales, marketing as well as the platform that supports the advisory business. And we've got plans to do more and to continue capturing market share. We're doing -- the pipeline is strong. 
There's another space there that I really didn't even mention and that is institutional clearing. It's something that we're uniquely positioned to do, and we're seeing more and more as even bigger broker dealers look to outsource, trying to reduce some of the capital requirements and balance sheet requirements as well as just gaining efficiencies. And the connectivity that Pershing has to our clearing and collateral and tri-party business is a unique offering. So we see opportunities there as well.",positive,0.5789,0.0129,0.4082

17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"It's going to be difficult in the short term. That's why I want to get them behind us. As I just indicated, Brian, on a year-over-year basis, that fee waiver was $74 million in the quarter -- $73 million in the quarter for Pershing. Once we get -- absolutely, once we get that set, then we're working back to recover it.",neutral,0.3251,0.0331,0.6419
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Yes. That makes sense. And then your comments on the data offering, 20% of the pipeline. Can you just talk about the role of Aladdin within that? I know you've integrated that into some of the servicing process. And you also mentioned the ESG app that's obviously starting, still in early phase. But maybe if you can talk about what you're doing there, is that aggregating data from the other ESG services or are you actually putting a proprietary analytical engine on the ESG that might generate some additional growth? And are you beginning to charge for that yet?",neutral,0.1093,0.0126,0.8781
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. So Brian, let me focus on the ESG app first. So it's a little bit of both. So basically, the client brings the license to us. So we have integrated or we'll connect to as many as 100 different ESG data providers. And we've built a whole -- we'll use the unitization factors or we'll also kind of customize factors that are most frequently used. And so you can run your own analytics against those factors. Probably the neatest thing that we've done against it is we've built a crowdsourcing app as well. 
So there's a sharing of which factors, which data suppliers appear to be the most trusted. And if it -- and it also shows you how much data there is on each of the factors that you're looking at, so whether you can even trust that factor or not. And when there's a lack of information or the quality of information is challenged by the crowd, we're feeding that information back to the data providers so they can constantly improve it. 
So we think it's pretty innovative. It's -- and the -- we're agnostic to where the data is. They can feed it to us. If we're the custodian, we can flip the switch and turn it on for them. So that's the -- that particular app.

And we think that our integration is more robust. We truly have integrated through single sign-on and the data feeds also across more asset classes. 
And ultimately, it's not only beneficial to us but it's also beneficial to those service providers. And the last thing I would just mention about open architecture, it's not just about the front end.

12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Todd, you mentioned earlier that a couple of the businesses were just kind of quiet this quarter. I wanted to ask you just a bigger question when you think across the businesses, the activity-driven businesses versus the really strong first quarter, things have kind of settled down. Do you get a sense that we kind of are now at normal levels of activity when you think across the more transactional parts of the company?",negative,0.0337,0.7764,0.1899
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Ken, so I'd say the answer to that is yes. And I'd also say the third quarter was, I mean, typically, it's a little bit of a seasonal quarter to slow down into vacation. We actually saw that this quarter and -- versus a year ago where you had the blip in the repo markets and some unusual things and some unusual revenues related to that. We didn't see -- this looked more like the seasonality that we would typically see in the quarter. So it feels, at least for the time being, that there is a level of normalcy around the volumes and activity.",neutral,0.1563,0.1491,0.6946
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. And a follow-up on the buyback, Todd. Loud and clear that you're ready to go. Would there be anything -- if the Fed were to lift the buyback restriction after 4Q, is it just onto your own decisioning from there? Is there anything either politically or regulatory that could get in the way of you guys just ready to plow back into the buyback? 
And related, how would you start to think about if you were able to get back in? Do you go right back to buying back 100% total capital return or do you have to kind of leg in?",neutral,0.0528,0.0294,0.9178
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. So -- I mean one of the benefits of the new regime, once it gets fully implemented, the stress to capital buffer, it's no longer a program where we submit a plan with X amount of buybacks by period, and if we vary from that plan, we have to make an adjustment or a resubmission. It is we have to maintain our stressed capital buffer. And so we're not restricted by timing and the implications of that. So we actually -- we think it's a very logical approach, and we look forward to operating within it because I think it gives us more of the agility that you're pointing to there, Ken. 
Now in terms of political consequences or we're -- I mean that's really outside of our control. The Fed is meant to be an apolitical institution. And I think they will go through the stress test. They'll make their own assessments, and they will determine what actions they are going to permit.",neutral,0.0858,0.0228,0.8914

27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"I wanted to start off with a question on capital. Emily, I appreciate you drawing a line in the sand, outlining the 50 -- roughly 50 to 100 bps of excess Tier 1 leverage you have today. Admittedly, like when we start to run various scenarios in terms of significant deposit uplift and if there is like a negative market shock that we ultimately experience, that 5.5% to 6% target, it still feels quite conservative. And just wanted to get some context as to why you feel that's the appropriate level that you need to manage to? And how could that potentially evolve over time if you find that the deposits prove to be stickier and the balance sheet volatility ultimately proves to be less as the COVID pressure starts to abate?",neutral,0.13,0.0526,0.8174
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. I can take that, and Todd, you can add if you want. In terms of -- it is worth mentioning from a deposit perspective, our deposits are trending about 3% up from where they were in the second quarter. So they're -- that just gives you some...",positive,0.9445,0.0237,0.0318
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,Trending in the third quarter.,neutral,0.2599,0.0568,0.6834
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sorry, in the third quarter. Apologies, in the third quarter. They're currently around 3% up. And ultimately, when it comes to just thinking about the Tier 1 leverage, you are correct, it is our binding constraint. 
Having said that, we have done very well on all of our stress tests which have taken into account very severe market shocks. And we do feel that the buffer that we've talked about is certainly sufficient, and you are correct that we're running above that. And as a result, our excess -- certainly excess capital to the extent there is an additional surge in deposits.",positive,0.8334,0.1237,0.0428
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I'd add to that, Steven, and I'd say when you look at your capital ratios, you have to look at them kind of BAU and current operating conditions. So yes, we've got a massive excess relative to that. And if you -- and to your point, is it more stable? Well, we've already gotten a significant uptick due to the activities coming out of the Fed, and fiscal is not going to -- it's probably not to have anything like that to the underlying deposit base. So we're really positioned to handle growth, but we also have to run it through the stress test. 
So it's not just normal business conditions, but through stress, that Tier 1 leverage ratio could be a constraint, and that's what we're playing out. So the buffer reflects both what could be an increase in the deposits for any particular sharp upturn as well as what we need just to meet -- to run a traditional stress test.",neutral,0.2556,0.0885,0.6559
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"And just 1 follow-up from me regarding some of the discussion regarding some of the organic fee green shoots that were cited earlier. And over the last couple of years, PPNR has contracted. It's almost been exclusively driven by NII and interest rate pressures. Core fees have been running flattish. Expenses have also been running flattish and you've tried to maintain discipline there. 
As we think about a scenario where, say, in 12 months, if some of those organic fee green shoots that were cited, if we're still running at flattish fee income, I just want to get a sense as to how you're thinking philosophically about how you want to manage the expense base? And if we're not seeing that pickup in organic fee growth, how your philosophy around that might evolve?",neutral,0.0734,0.3607,0.5659
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. I'll make a couple of comments on that note. When you look at that fee growth, it's also absorbing, and we pointed to $150 million fee waivers per quarter. So that's an enormous number. So underneath that, there has to be some growth in order to sustain where we are. And we think we're going to be able to continue that. 
Obviously, based on conditions and what actually happens to revenues, we will take harder and harder look at expenses. We've been able to make the investments in technology, resiliency, automation, cyber, everything that we've done to make ourselves a stronger company. I got to admit, it actually is more and more important, having gone through this last crisis, that clients see the benefit of resiliency of a global operating model that was able to meet huge increases in volumes. And so if anything, I think we'll probably see more as a result of that. 
So we've been able to do all of that and manage the expenses, and we'll drop more to the bottom line based on what happens to the revenue picture.",positive,0.5382,0.1403,0.3215
0,Operator,,We will take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.,neutral,0.0352,0.0328,0.932
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Just a quick question on the asset management business. I know there was a restructuring there in the past and combining some of the boutiques that you had stand-alone. But now what we've seen across the asset management space is certainly more interest in consolidation. So I guess can you maybe address that from both sides of it, like what's the opportunity to, one, do acquisitions and what's the appetite as well to maybe get rid of -- not rid of, potentially divest some of these businesses within asset management?",neutral,0.0844,0.0187,0.8969
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Sure, Brian. It's been kind of interesting as you start to see a little more action. I think as you think about that business, there are kind of really 3 drivers of success, and that's probably what's -- now. And that's probably what's moving some of the action. I think it comes down to scale; integrated distribution, if you have it; and obviously, performance. 
And so if you look at -- we are a $2 trillion of AUM. So we have meaningful scale. Our performance has actually been pretty darn good. One of the things I cited in my opening remarks is that our 30 largest funds, where there are indices for them to follow and they make up about 60% of our revenues, are performing in the top one -- or first or second quartile. So -- and that's been -- and they've been there over the last 3 years. So I think we're well positioned and it's reflective. 
We've got some pretty interesting assets underneath there. The liability-driven investment has been growing. And it's a business that we think we can -- it's primarily in the U.K. and Europe. It's something I think we can import into the U.S. We've got one of the world's largest credit managers. We just put a new CEO in place there. This is primarily a European credit manager, and I think there's significant opportunity for it to grow. Probably underperformed in the past couple of years. It's done fine, but I think it missed opportunities to grow faster. 
And if you think about our distribution, we're pretty interesting, too, because we have a wealth manager. It's open architected, but it delivers some of our manufacturing capabilities. And Pershing is also a very powerful platform, again, open architected. But it's a platform where there's real estate for some of our product and probably more potential there. 
So we've got a number of the components. So we're watching very carefully what's going on in the industry. And if something made sense on our platform, then we have to give it hard consideration.",neutral,0.3271,0.0149,0.658
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"And then just a second question. I mean last earnings call, you talked about the potential cost saves opportunity from how you rethink workforce or workplace. In the future, as the stemming from work from home and the pandemic, how far along are you rethinking the workforce or workplace of the future and when you could actually see some cost saves come through from that?",neutral,0.0585,0.0604,0.881
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. So as we think about it, it's going to impact real estate. It's going to impact things like disaster recovery sites because we've created a new amazing disaster recovery capability here. It will certainly impact longer term, what we think, business development, travel, entertainment, those type of costs. So there's a number of areas throughout the organization. 
We've done -- we're starting to do a pretty deep analysis on who needs to be in the office all the time, who doesn't need to be in the office any other time and who should be in the office some of the time. And my view is there is a -- there is -- there continues to be a compelling argument for aggregating, it leads to innovation, it leads to building really the performance culture that you want to inculcate into the company difficult not to do it without some in present meetings, I do think travel and seeing clients is still critical. I think it will change a little bit. And the use of some of the technology now will be much more frequent. We've all gotten pretty astute at it as well, even me. 
And so I think that will all change. So we're kind of laying out where we could go and what the implication to our real estate is. But that's going to -- but for that to factor into the P&L will take some time. And ultimately, as much as we might think it should go one way or the other, the market is also going to dictate it a bit, too, because the -- we have a lot of technologists and if the market starts to lean to more work from home, we'll adjust to that.",neutral,0.0769,0.0252,0.8979

10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Todd, you mentioned, obviously, the binding constraint for your capital, the leverage ratio. And when you look at your balance sheet, I think you said it’s related today, it's up about 15% from a year ago. 
Can you share with us where do you think it should be under normal conditions? And how long did it take to get there? And what would we need to see in the macro environment for you guys to actually reach a more normalized size of the balance sheet?",positive,0.7594,0.012,0.2286
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I think the balance sheet probably will grow traditionally with the growth in the underlying businesses, which if you think about the AUC and there's a relationship to that. If you think about what's going on with Pershing payables, there's a relationship to that. The Treasury Services business, for example, Gerard, we took a -- we went on a campaign. We said we probably -- we're too shy in taking on deposits when there was an opportunity. We're a great counterparty and our clients wanted us to grow our deposits there. 
So I feel some of that was core growth underneath it. It's hard for me to really estimate exactly what the -- what is excess versus what would have been the traditional growth over that period and what would have grown based on our own internal efforts. But I would expect -- there certainly is some excess in it. And I would expect, if there is a change in interest rates and we don't see that in the near term, that would contract a bit, obviously, maybe a lot more profitable but contracted a bit.",neutral,0.35,0.0475,0.6025
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Very good. And then coming back to something you said earlier in the call about organic growth.

17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. So if we -- first of all, existing customers are great customers because they don't have the implementation costs and everything else about it is less. So if a new fund -- if a client opens up a new fund and they've got multiple custodians, and we're the ones winning the new funds, that's organic growth, and it's very important to our organic growth and it demonstrates the quality of our services and the capabilities that we've got. And that's where we're seeing meaningful improvement. So we would include that as well as new customers.

That's part and parcel of the open architecture that we've been talking about, and it's all about data integration. And that's going to take a while, that's a journey. But -- and every client looks and feels slightly different. So we're kind of solving for many different outcomes. But ultimately, that's part of the open architecture strategy in that we want to offer best-in-breed and as much flexibility and optionality to our clients as we can.",neutral,0.16,0.0138,0.8261
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"And the other thing that I would add is that when we look at our technology, there's still a lot of legacy technology debt. And one of the commitments and so the -- when you look at where we're actually being forced to invest, it's in a lot of older systems. And we could run those systems much more efficiently. Of course, they're effective. They run, they're industrial, like a lot of banks and just about all banks have the same issues. 
As we cloud enable and make our underlying applications more and more efficient, there will be opportunity. There will be long-term opportunity to get rid of a lot of that legacy technology debt. So this is -- so we don't see this as a 1- or 2-year effort. I think it is just -- it is just making the commitment to constantly reinvest to actually get it done because it does take investment to make that transition. And so we're trying to incorporate that into our investment activities so that we get to renew that stack. 
So it's a combination of both what's going on in the operations, how efficiently we can be operating our corporate functions as well as how efficiently we can operate our technology.
