0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0373,0.0221,0.9406
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Thanks for the time this morning. A couple of questions. One, Todd, you mentioned the virtual presentation that you gave or the virtual conference that you gave. And I wanted to understand how important that is for generating new client activity? And if you think that, that virtual kind of format and forum can deliver the same kind of client activity growth that you've seen in prior years, [indiscernible]?",neutral,0.1219,0.0138,0.8644
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. First of all, in terms of engaging with our clients, it's been pretty effective. I think initially, I think there was a little reticence as we moved into the crisis, but now we basically see this as our BAU. And so both clients and I think ourselves have gotten quite a bit better at managing the technology to actually communicate and connect and share what we're doing. So this particular conference where we had about 1,000 clients and vendors come into it was -- we also posted on our website, a whole series of detailed analysis of some of the new capabilities that are out there and available to them. And the hits against that have been very high. So I think it's been pretty effective. We've actually seen the pipeline grow. We've also seen retention high and actually, sales are up in the first half of the year over where we were last year.",positive,0.7735,0.0175,0.209
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then Mike, on the guidance, could we just dig in a little bit on the NII contract that you gave? I think you said NII down 8% to 11%. Maybe just give us some color on the drivers there? And is it -- and why do you see it ameliorating as you go into 3Q and 4Q? And if you could give us a sense of the differences in the drivers between deposit growth and yield compression, that'd be helpful.",neutral,0.0855,0.2018,0.7127
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, sure, Betsy. So I think when you look at the third quarter, it's really all about rates coming down and getting the full impact of that for the full quarter, that's really the primary driver. And there's a series of actions that I think you can see that we're taking in the results, both in increasing the securities portfolio and optimizing sort of how we're investing there. And so I think as you sort of lookout past the third quarter and you look at all the actions we're taking, plus you look at where the forward curves are that gives us some confidence that it begins to stabilize in the third quarter as we look forward. And obviously, the forward view on deposits will sort of have some impact on that but the marginal dollar gets a little less impactful with rates where they are.",neutral,0.25,0.0774,0.6726
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.,neutral,0.0375,0.0271,0.9354
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Maybe just a quick follow-up on the rate impact. We used to think an anchor might be the 2015 NIM low. But I guess, I appreciate the long end has come down more than it was then. You mentioned focusing on NII over net interest margins. So I guess there could be more down there. So my quickie is deposits sticking around despite the interest-bearing deposit rate being minus 3 basis points. I'm curious to hear any color on client conversations there. And if that's now at its resting point? Or is there more room on the negative side as clients park and have no other alternatives?",neutral,0.0479,0.3705,0.5815
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Mike, why don't I start that one, and then you can probably give a little bit of color. I think that we're -- again, the mix of deposits makes a big impact, Glenn, on that rate. So there are a fair amount of foreign deposits and European deposits that are actually carrying a negative rate, and we've passed that through to the clients. In the U.S., with the IOER around 10 basis points, that seems to be anchoring somewhat around that rate, unless we see changes going on in the money markets, which we haven't seen a whole lot of noise yet. So I think most of the downside pass-through has already been made. I don't know, Mike, if you have anything to add to that?",neutral,0.0814,0.1987,0.7199
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. No, I think that's right. I mean, I think the negative is really driven by euros, as Todd said, Glenn. And when you look at the U.S. dollar deposits, it's a low single-digit sort of interest rate paid now on the book. And so there's not a lot of room to continue to bring that down.",neutral,0.0838,0.2286,0.6876
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"I appreciate that. One qualifier on the provision. Obviously, we're riding to a worse economic backdrop, but you also mentioned the impact that downgrades have. So my question is if we move forward and the economic scenarios don't change. In other words, we feel like we're kind of where we're at, will further downgrades keep -- continue to be the gift that keeps giving on the provision? We're just trying to dimensionalize how much to bake-in if the economic scenario doesn't change?",neutral,0.0637,0.1105,0.8258
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Mike, you have anything to add?",neutral,0.0361,0.0463,0.9176
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, sure, Todd. So, Glenn, I think it's a tough question to ask, right? And so if things don't get worse from what is being projected now in the scenarios, then you would expect that the issuer downgrades should be somewhat limited from here, but there will be idiosyncratic issues that may change some of that. So I think, obviously, these -- the downgrades and the scenarios are somewhat interrelated as we sort of look at both of them.",neutral,0.0581,0.1583,0.7836
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,neutral,0.0346,0.0279,0.9375
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Mike, just a follow-up on the fee waiver commentary. I just want to make sure that we're talking about it the right way in terms of the total number versus the gross. So are you saying that you'd expect that growth to continue when you gave us the 2 sets of numbers. So just the cadence going forward? I guess, maybe if you can just help us understand the net trajectory from here would be the better way, I think, to help us think through that?",neutral,0.1599,0.0146,0.8256
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. No, no, sure. I know -- and I can appreciate it's probably a little complicated. But so as you sort of look at the net impact of $80 million to $100 million by the time we get to year end, underpinning that assumes that balances holds to about where they are. So it does not assume that there is additional growth there. And so I think if we do continue to see growth in the balances, we will see that get offset a bit as we look towards the end of the year.",positive,0.458,0.1022,0.4398
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. So right, that net number, the $80 million to $100 million minus $50 million from growth, that assumes the balances are flat from here. Okay. Geographically, a couple of quick things. Could you just help us understand the size of the onetime gain in asset servicing and then just can you talk through the -- just the income statement line asset servicing? Just what's happening underneath the surface there in terms of core servicing collateral and broker-dealer services?",neutral,0.0641,0.0256,0.9102
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Mike, do you want to take that one?",neutral,0.0421,0.0312,0.9268
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yeah, sure. So yes. So the onetime fee, Ken, is actually in other income. It's not in the asset servicing fee line. It's not something we have disclosed exactly what it is, not super meaningful, but it does show up in the other income line. So it doesn't impact your fee -- your asset servicing fees at all. As you sort of look at what's underneath asset servicing and the fee line, I think you're seeing growth in both the clearance and collateral management business and the asset servicing business, as sort of Todd pointed out the different drivers there that are sort of impacting that line.",neutral,0.1017,0.0256,0.8727
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0346,0.0302,0.9352
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Can you just -- one more on the fee waivers. Can we track the level of money market fund balances? I appreciate, obviously, there's assets funds in the asset management business, but it's also a number of third-party funds on the Pershing platform. So I don't know if you've got that disclosed for the level of those balances, and if it's something that we can track given the Pershing side, I don't think we can see?",neutral,0.0455,0.0214,0.9331
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Mike, do you want to take that one?",neutral,0.0421,0.0312,0.9268
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Yes, sure. And Brian, there's actually a couple of drivers underneath the fund balances. One, we're obviously seeing it Pershing, and that's not something that we disclose. And two, we're also seeing it growth in asset servicing as well, where we sweep money into money market funds through our open architecture platform there [indiscernible] but also a bunch of other [indiscernible]. Those 2 numbers are not something that we disclose. So we've seen growth across the platform, we've seen growth really in all channels.",neutral,0.2063,0.0271,0.7666
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Right. So you could have an organic growth dynamic in this that's different than the money market fund industry at large that could keep that -- the fee waivers closer or even less than $85 million to  $100 million, is that a feasible conclusion?",neutral,0.1016,0.0162,0.8822
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Potentially, yes, potentially.",neutral,0.1498,0.0211,0.8292
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Okay. And then just maybe just to talk on the new business and asset servicing. Todd, you mentioned a lot of initiatives partly from the tech investments on the data bulk and also the distribution analytics system. Any way to frame what type of -- or what level of the new business do you think you're getting from these initiatives in say the next -- or what you expect in the next, say, 6 months or so? And any kind of revenue impact or growth impact to asset servicing, you think, as a result of these initiatives?",neutral,0.079,0.0126,0.9084
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I think, first of all, some of these are very new and some of the applications that we've just put out there, we've just gone live in the past month or so. So our estimate is that we could see some meaningful growth driven by the data and -- the digital and data analytics that we're offering that we talked about. So it's just now gathering momentum. There is a lot of discussions. And -- but it's early. We've got a couple of beta clients on it that we described, and they actually participated in the ENGAGE conference, both Charles Schwab and Nuveen. But I think underlying it, if you look at our pipeline, if you look at the growth rate that we demonstrated, we are seeing a little bit of organic growth for the first time in a while.",neutral,0.3144,0.0149,0.6708
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0349,0.0314,0.9337
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So a couple of quick follow-ups. I guess first one is around NIR. So you guys talked about optimizing NIR off of sort of 3Q trough levels, which makes sense. Can you walk us through sort of the opportunities that you see to invest some of the excess cash that kind of compiled in the balance sheet into secures portfolio. So anything specifically you can point to in terms of how much could ultimately be moved to securities over time and sort of the yields you guys expect to earn on that? And then anything you guys could do on the liability side as well. So deposit costs will be kind of what they are with the market. But curious if there's an opportunity to further restack long-term debt so you guys do a little bit of that in the quarter.",neutral,0.0752,0.0192,0.9056
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,Mike?,neutral,0.0442,0.1011,0.8547
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Sure. Yes. I'll just -- I'll try to get all of those pieces, Alex, or remind me if I don't. So as you sort of -- maybe I'll start with the last 1 first. So if you look at the liability side, we're always looking for ways to sort of optimize. As you said, deposit costs are probably near where they're going to bottom in the U.S., but on the margin, there may be a little bit here and there with particular clients. On the long-term debt side, we are looking at optimizing that more. I think you'll see us kind of bring that down maybe just a little bit as we sort of look forward over the next quarter. But I think, obviously, we need to keep enough long-term debt to meet a bunch of different constraints that we've got, but we're -- but I do think there's a little bit of opportunity to optimize that as we look forward. 
On the security side, you can see the increases over there sequentially and year-on-year are pretty significant in terms of what we've been able to redeploy. The majority of that has gone into sort of highly liquid assets sort of HQLA as sort of the term goes, right? And I think you'll see us continue to put more into HQLA assets as well as look for opportunities where we can get the right risk profile and the right return for some less liquid assets as we sort of look forward. And as we sort of get more experience with the deposit base, and we've been talking about this now for a couple of quarters. As we sort of see the behavior of the deposits come on to the balance sheet. Each month, every 30, 60, 90 days, you get a better sense of what the operational nature and the duration of those deposits are going to look like. And so you can sort of keep -- you can keep optimizing how much you're going to deploy each month and each quarter as you look forward. And so we're doing that. So we still think there's some opportunity to continue to deploy more.",neutral,0.1457,0.0277,0.8266
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Great. That's helpful. And my second question is just around the expense outlook. I think early in the quarter, you guys spoke at a conference and the outlook for expenses for 2020, I believe it was flat to down, and it sounds like it's flat now. So what's changed or could expenses still decline this year? And maybe just a quick reminder in terms of how much incremental tech spend is running through P&L in 2020, which part of that, I guess, is supposed to phase out into 2021?",negative,0.0823,0.5189,0.3987
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Mike, why don't I start with this and maybe you can add some additional color. I think we've guided for a while that we'll be flat or around flat for the rest of the year, and I'm confident that we'll do that, at least that or better. And as we look out to next year, I think we've got significant opportunities around our efficiency programs, especially in operations. And the increased spend that we've made over the past couple of years in Tech will begin to abate as the investments in infrastructure and resiliency will be largely behind us. So we think we've got more that we can do here looking out over the next year or 2. Mike, do you want to give a little more color around the tech spend?",positive,0.5953,0.0217,0.383
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Look, I think as we've talked about, now, in the last couple of years, we've -- as Todd said, we've been making those investments in the operating platforms as well as other capabilities like we talked about with data and analytics and other new products across the different businesses. And I think while the growth rate has been slowing over the last year, I think, as Todd said, we've got much more flexibility to sort of look at that as we sort of exit the year. The only other thing I'd add is, we're seeing the benefit of the efficiencies come through. We're spending less in operations this year than we did last year. We're going to spend less next year than we did this year. And we feel very confident that we've got line of sight to continue to execute on the efficiency agenda as Todd mentioned.",positive,0.4685,0.2389,0.2926
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Right. And I think in 2020, Alex, I'll add to that, I think we probably made the biggest spend that we've made in tech in increasing efficiencies across -- the operating efficiencies across the company.",positive,0.8768,0.0109,0.1123
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0311,0.0338,0.9351
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Well, first, actually, I'd like to just start with the request. The fee waiver dynamic is -- it seems like there's a lot of moving parts. Just something to consider for coming quarters, maybe a little enhanced disclosure or maybe a memo disclosure, so we could try to consider how to model some of these components given that there's balance movement and all this other stuff. I know it's probably tricky. But it might help. But taking a step back, widening it back the lens a little. We're clearly in a rate environment that's a lot more challenging for your business model. The idea that monetary policy, low rates as a monetary policy tool. This certainly seems to be now the new normal, and it's not look a temporary thing that we're all dealing with here. Are you starting to think about different ways in which you can engage with your customer base, different ways in which you can structure your relationships in the deposit dynamics, so you can have more confidence in the duration of the deposits. How are you making adjustments? Or how are you thinking about making adjustments to sort of the fundamental ways in which you engage with your customers, so you can ensure that you can monetize the components of the -- of all these relationships in the most effective way, given low rates are going to be around for probably some time?",neutral,0.0798,0.0387,0.8815
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"So, Mike, why don't I take that? And then I think you can add some color to it. So first of all, Brennan, the comments around the fee waivers, we'll take that to heart. Look, I want to make sure something is clear because there might be a little confusion here. What we've indicated is that we think that the full impact of interest rates to our net interest income will begin to stabilize in the third quarter. And then -- which is basically saying that we're coming out with approximately that run rate as we go forward. And that's taking into consideration what we know today with the shape of the yield curve. So we see some stability here as we reset around the very low interest rate environment as we fully reset around it. That same impact is going to be fully reset through fee waivers by the end of the year. And if you look at the disclosures that Mike had given you, it's very specific to what that is. We don't know what the actual balances are going to be. So if the balances grow, then that impact can be quite a bit less because there'll be additional income related to money market balances. So I wanted to make that clear. In terms of how we're working with our clients and pricing, whether it's around -- whether it's directly around deposit activity or our treasury services they're certainly taking the interest rate environment into consideration. And anytime we put together more of our platform business like an asset servicing. We take that into the pricing discussion, taking whatever market conditions would be a likely implication to our margins and that type of activity. So that -- so we're doing that on a day-to-day basis. Mike, you have anything to add to that?",neutral,0.0721,0.0367,0.8912
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"No, I think that's right. And we're continuing to have a pretty close dialogue with a lot of the clients that have large or medium-sized sort of balances with us. And I think in part, as you look at a business like treasury services, it's ensuring that we get our fair share of the payments business and the fee revenue that comes along with having these balances. And so I think it's not only about optimizing sort of the reinvestment side of the balance sheet. It's also about making sure that we're monetizing the fee relationship with these clients as well. And that's as much a focus for us and our client and sales folks as is the balance sheet side of it.",neutral,0.1368,0.017,0.8462
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Yes. No, I appreciate that, and that's all very, very fair. When we think about capital, you flagged the strong showing of Bank of New York through the DFAST process. Can you talk about, like, clearly, you have a low-risk model. It was clearly showcased during the DFAST. But because you're categorized as a G-SIB, you are now continue -- you're constrained in the ability to return capital. And so even though you're pretty far above a lot of your requirements, you cannot manage the capital base as much as you will. How are the engage -- how is the engagement with the regulators as far as trying to point that out, are -- is there going to be a staggered start based upon risk -- inherent risk in the business model where the G-SIB's that are lower risk should be able to start returning capital sooner? Or is this going to be one of these things that all the G-SIB's are lumped together? And therefore, firms that have really, really minimal credit risk profiles like BK end up at the same starting line as some of the big investment banks and commercial banks?",neutral,0.0784,0.0698,0.8517
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. So Mike, I'll start with this one, too. So I mean, as you know, the stress test is a idiosyncratic test for us. And so as we go through it, we have performed quite well. We have submitted our capital action plans, and we have indicated that we will look and we performed quite well. And now there's going to be a reevaluation using some new scenarios that were sometime at the end of the third or [  second ] or fourth quarter. And so we'll go through that process. That being said, we expect to perform quite well, just given the resiliency, as you pointed out, of our balance sheet and our business model. One of the things that comes out of the new stressed capital buffer, the SCB model is that you get a little more flexibility around your buybacks, you don't have to -- you're not limited on a quarterly basis. You just need to stay within your SCB. So there could be a timing difference based on whatever regulatory considerations or the environment might look like. But ultimately, as we accrete capital, that just puts us in a stronger position to buy it back when that -- when the opportunity arises. So I like where we -- I like the way we are accreting capital, and I think that puts us in a position to buy back a considerable amount of stock as soon as possible.",neutral,0.3191,0.0189,0.662
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America.,neutral,0.0306,0.0264,0.943
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"So first, I just want to try to understand the activity that has been with COVID impact and could normalize if it had too. Any color on how much the deposit balance growth has been driven by some of the policy response it could normalize. And then you guys noted if new business wins, and that's an area that you would have expected to be a bit more challenging just in this environment? And so have you seen much impact? And do you see like a pipeline forming up sequentially just start to normalize as we get back?",neutral,0.0921,0.0383,0.8695
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"So Mike, can you clarify the first part of that question? I didn't quite catch it.",neutral,0.0424,0.0815,0.8761
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Yes, sure. The first part was just on the growth in deposit balances. I know it's hard to determine exactly what drive some of those balances. But some firms have tried to quantify what's been kind of impacted by the coronavirus and some of the policy responses versus what's more sort of core business operations. So that was the first part. And then the second part was just on the new business wins, you would have expected that to be a little bit more challenging in this environment, but it seems like you continue to have some decent wins there. So just wanted to try to gauge, how has that been impacted by this environment in terms of the pipeline?",neutral,0.1066,0.0519,0.8415
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Mike, do you want to take the deposit component of the question?",neutral,0.0355,0.0355,0.929
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Sure, Mike. So as you sort of look at what's happened since the middle of March, what you saw was this massive increase. And if you recall what our spot balance was at the end of the first quarter, it was $337 billion in terms of deposits. And so that huge volatile piece of the deposit balance has come off already. And as you can see where we were for the quarter in the 280s in terms of the average. And so you've already seen that sort of massive spike retreat. And so while it's -- in hindsight, you'll have a better view in terms of what's driven the increase from the February balances of around 230  to where we are today. But I think it's hard to ignore that -- the environment that's been caused -- the economic environment that's been caused by the pandemic is a big driver of the pace at which those deposits have increased from the February levels. But as we look forward, while we're in this environment, for sure, it feels like we're in this environment for longer. It's hard to see given all of the response, the policy, the monetary policy response from the Fed and others that the balances would retreat much more from where they are.",negative,0.1145,0.65,0.2356
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"And I can take the second component of your question, Mike, which was around the new business wins. I mean the clients are still making servicer decisions. And relative to last year, we've probably seen -- we've been winning and retaining more deals and higher value deals, which is important. I think we've learned how to work from home. We've ramped up our focus on client management over that time. And we're actually seeing an increase in activity with reviews and presentations being done virtually. And we've got some nice wins around EPS around our mid-office space, and we continue to implement at a rapid pace against the mid office. We've got the TALF servicing related wins as well. So the pipeline remains strong. I think we're just -- we're getting used to this as being the current normal.",positive,0.8621,0.0159,0.122
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Got it. Okay. And then Mike, you said a quick cleanup, there were just a few positive items in the quarter, I think some that investment gains in funds. And then you mentioned that other investment in income that asset servicing fee. Away from that, I'm assuming that most of it was just market-related, just given what we saw in the quarter. But were there any other factors and for those line items, I'm assuming we just expect that to normalize lower ahead, but just any color if there are any other nuances there?",neutral,0.1455,0.034,0.8206
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"No. I think it's pretty straightforward on those investment and other income. You can kind of see the breakdown of that in the supplement. The thing that will be in the other income line that will be volatile. Obviously, you see capital and how the market sort of moves within the quarter. And then the other trading line, you'll have some impact there as well from the same moves.",neutral,0.0643,0.0543,0.8814
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,neutral,0.0311,0.036,0.9329
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"I'm just trying to reconcile a couple of thoughts. Todd, you had some really positive comments with your introductory remarks and maybe you can elaborate some on your work with the government and what kind of fees you get from that? And how sustainable those fees are. But then Mike, you certainly commented about the impact of lower interest rates, and you're certainly not sugarcoating that. So that's trying to connect those 2 different thoughts. And the other 2 different thoughts I have is you guys are certainly service more fixed income assets than your peers. So you should be benefiting from that quite a bit. And I'm not sure if that's showing up as much as you might expect with the increased fixed income activity?",neutral,0.1849,0.0251,0.79
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes, Mike, thanks. So in terms of -- there are a number of government programs that we're participating or that we are supporting or administering, some of them are showing some growth. For example, the PDCF is where we use our tri-party repo system. So it's just -- it's reflected in the amount of tri-party repo activity. Which we did see go up in the first quarter and sustain itself, to a certain extent, although it's starting to come off a little bit in the second and third quarter. But we are seeing good activity on the global side of the tri-party book. And it's really going to -- it's going to be a matter of how much those programs are taken up before we see any revenue. I think the more important is the other component of our revenue growth across our Investment Services business. In terms of the fixed income activity, where you're seeing a clearing in collateral management, you are seeing increased clearing volumes on our clearing platform, and we are benefiting to a certain extent from that. And I think that was reflected. If you looked at the investment services uptick, in the highlights, you could see that. And I think we've been very directive where we are with the interest rates.

And I think that's to be expected and was happening already. I think the good news is, we're the only provider that has all our capabilities embedded inside of Aladdin. And so the widgets or the capabilities or the functionality that we've built are actually accessible through Aladdin, and we're the only ones that you can do that. So I think we've got a really strong relationship with BlackRock on the servicing side and the partnership side, and we look forward to continuing to build new capabilities with them that continue to differentiate what our common clients can do versus others, but we do think there's some differences there.",neutral,0.3169,0.0124,0.6707

10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"The question I have has to do with the credit quality. Clearly, you guys are not a credit-centric bank, like some of the universal banks. But can you give us some color on the provision that you put up, what -- you book out your portfolio. When is that provision allocated to that portfolio? And was it just general allocations or were there some specific reserves that you put against specific loans?",neutral,0.0372,0.0407,0.922
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Mike, do you want to take it?",neutral,0.0416,0.0282,0.9302
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, Gerard. So I would say generally, the build was related to commercial real estate portion of the portfolio. That's certainly where the biggest piece of it was. It's not a general sort of allocation. Obviously, it's a very detailed sort of name by name, and then you apply all the modeling that goes around with it. But as you sort of look at the bill, the biggest portion of it would be related to the commercial real estate portion.",neutral,0.0285,0.044,0.9275
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Very good. And then coming back to the deposit rates. You saw about, I guess, 11% or 12% increase in your foreign office deposits. And the average rate went in the first quarter, we paid 20 basis points, I think, or 29 basis points down to negative 12. What interest rates should we be watching overseas to the negative rates? And we had the growth, even though you went to negative rates. I think deposits essentially inelastic, meaning is there a point where you would be concerned that people would move money out as the negative rates went too negative?",neutral,0.1259,0.287,0.5871
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Mike, do you want to take that? [ It was ] for 29 to 12, yes.",neutral,0.0348,0.033,0.9322
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Sure. Yes. And Gerard, when you look at the disclosure there, domestic versus foreign offices, that doesn't necessarily denote currency denomination, a good chunk of the deposits in the foreign offices are actually U.S. dollar deposits. And so I think you really sort of need to look at the rate in aggregate when you think about what's happened over the quarter. I think when you look at the -- and so as you sort of look at that rate coming down, the biggest driver of the rate coming down in the foreign offices is actually us paying lower amounts on U.S. dollars, not increased negative rates outside the U.S. but obviously, the biggest driver for us other than U.S. dollar is going to be our euro deposits when you think about negative rates, and that's something we're focused on. I think when you think about our deposits inelastic, I think there's a portion of the deposits that are very much tied to the underlying operational activity. And so I think that there is -- we have -- we do -- when we charge clients for negative rates, there are spreads attached to those negative rates. And we haven't seen much movement as a result of the pricing and the spreads that we've applied to those deposits.",neutral,0.0604,0.2607,0.6789

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Perfect. And then just a quick follow-up on the expenses. I heard the flat expense guide this year, but obviously, there's a lot of kind of one-timers and unique nature going on given the current situation. So is that the right way to think about expenses as we look forward to '21 and that there should be a natural downward progression to expenses just as these one-timers go away. And then the rest of the -- you guys think about expenses which is really going to be driven by revenue growth in the next year so that there is some kind of downward by some expenses to start with for '21?",negative,0.0472,0.6129,0.3399
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Well, yes. What I had indicated there are a couple of good things. Number one, is I think the efficiencies that we've invested in will continue to register themselves next year. And over the next couple of years. And we're not slowing down on that. There's a lot more automation, a lot of additional things that we can do to make ourselves more efficient and actually improve the client experience at the same time. And on top of that, we have been growing our tech expense quite a bit over the past 3 years. A lot of that was infrastructure, resiliency as well as some of the efficiency investments and some of the product capabilities. We think a firm of the infrastructure component of that will be behind us, which should give us a bit of a tailwind as we look out over the next couple of years.",positive,0.6341,0.0239,0.3421

7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Mike, just maybe just to dive in a little bit more on the balance sheet. Deposit levels, I think, at period end were up at [ 305 versus the 283 ] average. So maybe just some commentary on whether you think that was the typical quarter end spike? Or do you think those levels are -- and the period levels of deposits are sustainable as you see it right now in 3Q? And then just on the securities mix that you talked about moving more short-term shifting to balance sheet composition towards security as you get confidence in those durability of the deposits. What type of level do you think that mix could go up to you from the 43%? Because I guess you could potentially get some NIM expansion after this bottoms in 3Q if you do that?",neutral,0.2293,0.0213,0.7494
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Sure. I'll start with the first one, Brian. I think the -- you can't read much into 1 days worth of deposit balances. And so I would sort of put that in the bucket of a typical quarter end spot number. And so sometimes, that will be higher, sometimes it will be lower. And there was 1 deposit that sort of drove that up a little bit for a particular client. So I think the guidance I gave around the current levels are slightly below where the average was is probably a good way to sort of think about where we are right now. I think as you sort of think about how much we can deploy into the securities portfolio I think that's something that's dynamic based on sort of how we feel about the stability and the longevity of those deposits. You'll see us continue to optimize as we go into the quarter. It's not something we'll give you a specific percentage on because obviously, there are other drivers of that, but we do think there's continued opportunity there.",neutral,0.1243,0.0715,0.8042
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the deposits and money market fund balances. Are you agnostic mostly between that client usage as that cash moves around between third-party money market balances and drive this, of course, as well versus the deposits on the balance sheet in those programs? Or I guess, the question there, are you agnostic as to where that lands? Or are you trying to favor 1 area over the other in terms of revenue generation capabilities, I guess, on the fee versus the balance sheet side?",neutral,0.0447,0.0512,0.9041

17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. Mike. I think the answer is it depends, Brian. I think when you think about short-term balances, that we know won't be around for very long. I think we are relatively agnostic with IOER at 10 basis points of where they go, whether it's in a money market fund or on the balance sheet. I think we'll earn about the same. I think as you sort of think about operational deposits, we are -- over time, we'll make more money with them being on the balance sheet.

4,Alexander Blostein,,"Sorry for the [indiscernible] but back to this money market fund dynamic real quick. So, Mike, I think on the last update, you guys had said you expect the pretax impact on a quarterly basis from money market fee waivers to be about $50 million to $75 million. And you talked about that being probably at the higher end of that range in the second quarter. Now you guys guiding to $80 million to $100 million by the end of the year. So I just want to make sure that these 2 numbers are kind of comparable. And essentially, we're just talking about $20 million more in sort of incremental pretax input from fee waivers.",neutral,0.109,0.0526,0.8384
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. It's a good question, Alex. I think the -- when you look at the $50 million to $75 million, at that point, it was unclear what was going to happen with money fund balances. And so I think the $50 million to $75 million was the gross impact. And as we sort of look at the $85 million to $100 million, that's the net impact of now is accounting for the fact that we think the balance growth that we saw is going to stick with us for a while. So if you look at what I gave in my script, I said by the fourth quarter, the gross impact will be $135 million to $150 million, which is equivalent to that $50 million to $75 million, but it will be offset by the fact that we think the balances will stick around. So that's how you get them from $85 million to $100 million.",neutral,0.0803,0.0494,0.8704
