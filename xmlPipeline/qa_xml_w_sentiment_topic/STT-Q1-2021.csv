0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0461,0.0236,0.9303
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So maybe we could start with servicing fees. I was hoping, first, we could unpack sort of Q1 dynamics a bit more. So ex currency translation, servicing fees were up about 4% sequentially. Maybe you can just kind of walk us through how much was the market versus sort of -- and higher volumes versus more kind of organic trends in the quarter. 
And then taking a step back, it really sounds like momentum in front to back is progressing pretty nicely. So I was hoping you could bridge these data points you highlighted on the call, sort of back to the servicing fee algorithm that, Eric, you talked about in the past kind of between markets pricing, new business, I think collectively, that added up to like maybe a low single-digit growth over time. Kind of how does that feel to you guys now given some of the changes you've seen in the business?",neutral,0.3453,0.0227,0.6321
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Alex, it's Eric. Let me start on the quarter and then we'll talk a little more about the momentum in the business. I think we felt like we had a solid quarter here. As you saw, servicing fees were up 7% year-over-year in aggregate. I mentioned about 3 percentage points of that, which is currency translation. So the underlying growth was around 4%. If we were to decompose the 4%, and you know there's always a mix of items here, the largest positive driver was equity market appreciation. So equity market appreciation across the low equity markets were up north of 20% on average. That translated to about a 6% tailwind in servicing fees for the quarter. And then against that, we had the normalized amount of -- the normal amount of fee headwinds of about 2%, which brought us down to the net 4%. 
So it was a good quarter. I think what we continue to focus on is there tends to be some tailwind in our model from flows and client activity. This quarter, we had some of that, but we also had it a year ago in a good amount, so that was relatively neutral on a year-on-year basis. 
And then the other component is net new business. And as I've said, I think, pretty clearly, we have had lighter sales quarters in the -- over the last 4 to 6 quarters. We need to take that up. And as that happens, we'll be in a position to have net new business growth. 
For the time being, net new business is relatively neutral, which is okay, but not enough and not at the levels that we'd like to be. And that's, I think, partly why we have been real clear around the amount of net new business we need to win. We've been actioning that on a segment basis or regional basis. You've heard about our coverage model expansion. All those are components of that acceleration, which I think are well along and starting to show some positive results, as I highlighted in asset managers, for example, in alternatives. And that I think will be to our advantage in the coming time periods.",neutral,0.452,0.0621,0.4859
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Alex, why don't I just add to that, the second part of your question, how does -- I think what you're basically asking is how does Alpha fit in all this and how does it change those numbers. Clearly, the -- we're pleased with the progress with Alpha 3 reported wins in the first quarter. And as we noted, one that we reported already for the second quarter, about 1/3 of our business to be installed, the $463 billion to be installed is Alpha-related. And we would expect that to grow just given some of the things that we've talked about. 
What that means, though, is these are longer installations, right? We're, remember, in effect, we're becoming the enterprise outsourcer to these clients. So it will be nice revenue impact, but we're talking about 2022 and 2023 revenue impact, relatively, little of that, certainly of the things that we reported for the first quarter will we see in 2021.",neutral,0.1789,0.0154,0.8057
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. Understood. And then maybe a quick one on capital. Obviously, ratios came down sequentially for the reasons that you described, not particularly surprising. I guess maybe talk to us a little bit about the willingness to dip below 5.25% Tier 1 leverage if the balance sheet remains elevated or maybe even grows from here for one reason or another. 
And if you guys are willing to sort of continue to execute on your capital return plan, how much flexibility do you have going below the low end, I guess, of your target and staying there?",neutral,0.1441,0.1231,0.7327
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Alex, it's a good question. We're on the capital return plan, that's largely driven by our common equity tier 1 ratios, which had some volatility this quarter, but are still solidly above, I think, or we'll return solidly above where we -- the range. So we've got confidence in what we can do there. 
On Tier 1 leverage, there are probably a couple of different aspects of that matter. I think, first, we'd like to operate in this quarter of 5.25% to 5.75%. And we have some -- a little more room in the balance sheet to -- if we get pushed on deposits. But as you remember, we also have some ability to adjust that. If you recall, we added some discretionary deposits over the last 2-year time period, and those are in the $10 billion, $15 billion, $20 billion range. So there's some tactical ways we can accommodate clients and then continue to manage the size of the overall balance sheet. 
I think we certainly have an ability occasionally to move outside and below the range on the 5.25% if we're the right way around. And right now, it's right-way risk, so to speak, because it's clients rather is coming to us because of the strength of our brand that's pushing that ratio. And so we can always do that for a quarter or 2, if necessary. And so part of what we're very mindful of is how do we continue to support our clients during this time of Fed easing. And so there are ways to navigate through that in -- during the year, and we kind of see that as just part of our normal business activity.",neutral,0.1647,0.0209,0.8144
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.,neutral,0.0379,0.0393,0.9228
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"So there's some good things going on in the quarter, but I think the ROE and the pretax margin are still pretty far below targets. I think the margin one is in, over time, given the headwinds on rates and fee waivers that you just described. But on the ROE side, do you view that as simply a function of capital built in getting down to your -- closer to your targets because it felt like better than an 8% ROE quarter, the momentum in the business feels better than that, but that's a low ROE, considering all the growth that you built. So just curious on how you think about that.",neutral,0.1294,0.24,0.6307
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Glenn, let me start. A couple of things just to keep in mind first. First quarter every year is always our low point on margin and ROE because of the seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenses. So those come through, and then we've got to take a full year look. So I'll just be a little cautious on that. 
I think, more broadly, in terms of ROE is absolutely a focus. I think you've seen in our proxy over the last few years, ROE as a management -- has a management target. We added margin to that and now fee revenue. So we're incredibly focused on those 3 major leverage points. And I've got to tell you, I've got entire management team who's thinking about those every month and every quarter. 
I think the way I think about ROE is probably from a couple of perspectives in terms of its trajectory. I think, first, continued work on margin. And this year, we're just trying to hold margins steady, notwithstanding given the falling interest rates. But you've seen us actually hold expenses flat and fee revenues up. That is going to, over time, extend margin and then -- and filter back into ROE. And every 2 points of expansion in margin is a point of ROE. So there's real, I think, flow-through there. 
And then I think the second one is, you hinted, is around capital return. We're very pleased to return 100% of earnings this year in line with this year, this quarter, in the first quarter, in line with the Fed limits. We've done that again in the second quarter. And we're committed to a pattern of capital return as a way to return capital to investors and to drive up ROE. And so I think there's a path in that way as well.",neutral,0.2238,0.0335,0.7428
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"I appreciate that. Maybe one quick follow-up on the fee waivers. I heard your comments on $15 million growing to $50 million and $40 million net. Just as a sequential number, that's a big step-up. And I know how it works generically, but I'd love to hear how you think about like was a yield wire, obviously, trip, so to speak, in the quarter? And then more importantly, how much and which part of the current needs towards or which reference points need to go up over what level to get us back to a more breathable level? Because $15 million to $50 million is a big step.",neutral,0.2105,0.013,0.7765
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Glenn, it's Eric. I think the good news here is while we have some fee, money market fee waivers, we don't have the size of money market fee waivers that others are seeing around the industry just because of the more institutional nature of our money market complex. So I take some -- I think that's some context to help with. 
The money market fee waivers are effectively driven by short-end rates. It could be everything from overnight repo to 1-month and 3-month treasuries. And effectively, as 1- and 3-month treasuries fell from kind of 8, 9 basis points down to 3, 4 and 5 basis points in March, you're starting to get to the point where the reinvestment rate against the management fee rate starts to be inflected. And as a result, we are at that pressure point. And literally, the 4 or 5 basis point move at the front end does have the impact as you've seen. 
I think the good news here is we've continued to see cash inflows into our complex. Part of that comes from the easing and the monetary policy that we're seeing. Part of that is, I think, we have an attractive set of offerings. And I'll tell you that that's all been factored into our guide and part of what we're managing through.",neutral,0.2015,0.1004,0.6981
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0374,0.0419,0.9207
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Just maybe one more on rates. Maybe just focus on the net interest revenue outlook, the $460 million to $465 million on a quarterly basis. What -- given the view of both the forward curve and premium amortization likely easing down over the course of the year, even if short rates are sort of stable where they are now, what would prohibit that $465 million from improving in the second half? Is there a mix shift assumption within the next -- I would have thought it would improve as we get to the later part of the year.",positive,0.413,0.2883,0.2987
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brian, it's a good question. The way -- I think the best way to understand it is the short rates had an impact in the first quarter, and then we'll now have 3 months' worth of that in the second quarter, so that's what drives the additional nudge down from what we would have preferred to have seen. 
On long-end rates, long-end rates have been a headwind all through last year as they came down. And now, even at this current level, are a headwind for the portfolio. They were a headwind in the portfolio, for example, from 4Q to 1Q by about 5 points of NII, but has started to work against the long-end rate impact is premium amortization, which has started to come down, and that was actually a tailwind sequentially of about 2 points of NII. 
And so you're kind of having this continued headwind from long-end rates, which will -- which just has to play through. Remember, the average duration of the portfolio is in -- is about 3 years. Think about when long rates were -- when the rate cycle started was a year ago, so there's another year of long-end rates being a headwind. 
What we're now looking for is the premium amortization to slow down. Now we need to be careful about the pace of that slowing down, but that is expected to slow based on the various models. And that starts to create a partial offset to those long-end rate headwinds. And what we're looking for is the crossover point. And we think sometime in the second half of this year, long-end rates will still be a headwind, but premium amortization should begin to offset that and thus, the collection of those 2 will be roughly neutral. 
And that's effectively why we don't see an uptick because that long-end rate headwind just continues on effectively for the -- for that 2- to 3-year time period that has to flow through the books. And what we need to see over time is for premium amortization to fall substantially enough so that there is some uplift. We just don't see that happening this year. And I think the question is how and when that begins to turn. And what I'm trying to do is avoid getting out ahead of us because we just need to see it play out, and I think we'll know more in the coming couple of quarters.",negative,0.0536,0.5605,0.3859
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Yes. That really makes sense. Good color. And then on the Invesco win. So Just to maybe talk about the calibration of revenue and expense, you, typically, when you have these installments, there's a little bit of an expense ahead of time before the revenue comes in. Maybe if you could just characterize if that's the case. Or do you actually -- are you actually able to build revenue sort of immediately after it's installed to offset that? 
And then I think you were doing the -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you were doing most of the custody fund accounting for Invesco. So this, optically, would be an add-on in revenue, but your custody base wouldn't change so much. Therefore, it would be -- it would appear to be a price improvement given it's -- you're getting more revenue from the same customer. Maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit?",neutral,0.1782,0.0254,0.7965
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brian, let me just step back a little bit because we're not and we've never really talked about individual clients, individual client wins and how we onboard the revenues, expenses. You're getting at a level of, I think, specificity. That's not something we typically go into. And we don't because we want to be respectful of our clients, respectful of various positions. 
I think what I would tell you is, and you've seen us with other wins describe them. We often say that there's a range of products that come over from a client as part of a win, some come more quickly and some take more time. And I think I've been on record saying custody tends to come more quickly often, but not always. Accounting, middle office, Charles River takes time. And the larger the installations, the more time it takes. 
And you are right that says that in your view that some of those expenses we build a bit in advance because we've got to onboard, we've got to do some of the professional development and technology connectivity for that. So anyway, I think you have the right outline, and I think what we're going to do in general is help everyone understand the momentum of our business. Part of the reason I gave the quarterly guidance is to give you a little bit of insight to what we expect. And that's all of our client activity, all of our wins, our to-be-installed business factors in.",neutral,0.0672,0.03,0.9028
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0346,0.0383,0.9271
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Ron, I had a question just around how you're thinking about strategy in SSgA. I mean there's been some headlines around the fact that perception that you've been looking at opportunities over in Europe and wanted to understand how important it is for you to gain share in Europe. And maybe you could broaden out the answer, of course, to just generally the strategy in SSgA. Could you give us a sense as to what you're looking to do and capability adds that you're trying to accomplish?",neutral,0.1793,0.0151,0.8055
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. So I mean, I'll start by just reminding everybody that asset management is a very important business for us. It's smaller than investment servicing, but we have quite a good business there. And as we've said oftentimes, we're constantly looking at our strategy. We're looking -- we always look at -- first at organic opportunities to grow. And second, inorganic opportunities to grow. And we've done a little bit of inorganic, but most of what you see in terms of the progress there has been a result of organic activities, including some of the, as I noted in my remarks, some of the recent growth in Europe. 
I mean I'm not going to comment on market rumors. We feel very good about the position we have and don't feel that we have to do something at any point, but we also are looking for opportunities to exploit the position we have and to see if there's opportunities to grow it. But it will, for us, be primarily driven by organic activities. And secondarily, if there's something inorganic that makes sense strategically and makes sense to the shareholders, then we'll look at that.",neutral,0.1365,0.0126,0.851
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then just separately, and maybe there's -- if there's any capability sets there that you're looking to expand into, that would be helpful to understand. But just on the eye in the servicing side, we've also seen some announcements on servicing Bitcoin ETFs. And maybe you can give us a sense as to how long you anticipate it takes to bring that to market. And is there anything else you're doing on the crypto side or digital currency side? In particular, are you going to be looking to service physicals? Or do you expect to use others to service physicals and subcustodians? Just your strategy there would be helpful to understand.",neutral,0.0978,0.0123,0.8899
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. I'll start, and Eric will probably want to add to this. So listen, there's a lot of activity in this space and crypto means a lot. It means different things to different people. We've been active in certainly digital ledger and blockchain technology for a long time now. We do see this as a growing segment of the marketplace. We've got a number of initiatives in place to figure out how we can establish a leadership position there. 
There's -- I think it's fair to say that there's -- the regulatory environment has some catching up to do here. And that's clearly on the minds of regulators, and there's clearly lots of applications in front of them. But right now, that's part of the gating factor. But we would view this as a trend that's here to stay. And I think it's a combination of how do you think about cryptocurrencies and servicing cryptocurrencies in the fullest form, not just traditional currency but administration. How do you think about in the context of an ETF, what does crypto basket creation look like? 
But then there's the other side of this, it's crypto assets, and we're very active in thinking about how do we move from custody, something that's physical or near physical to custodying a token and what does that mean for us. So it's a very, very important part of our R&D, and it's a very, very important part of our share of mind now.",neutral,0.0761,0.018,0.9059
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Betsy, I'd just add that, as Ron described, there's a whole -- across the whole value chain, all right? There are ways for us to participate in crypto and you've seen us do that, announced a number of partners has minority investments and so forth. I think we're also very conscious of where is the white space, where are there near-term opportunities. And we think ETF, crypto ETF is an important one. Why? because it takes something that is a bit on the side, a little bit more retail and makes it mainstream. It makes it mainstream for retail and for institutions. It increases access. 
And so we're very active and you saw one announcement. We've got a strong pipeline of clients because these are, by and large, our clients who are innovating in crypto ETF. And while many of those need to go through a regulatory approval stage, they all need record keepers and administrators, right? The core of this is the credibility that we could bring. And we think that's a real area of white space where we can lean in and both support our clients and also be a real important participant and player in one of the emerging spaces.",neutral,0.1917,0.0113,0.7969
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,And when do you expect the capability will be up and running?,neutral,0.0993,0.0109,0.8897
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"The -- well, there are different capabilities, right? There's everything from custody of the tokens itself. So we often partner to do that, and we had subcustody relationships, just like we have subcustody relationships in core assets. Recordkeeping and administration is something that we have the capability today to do, which is why we've been appointed by several ETF providers who are in various stages of the regulatory approval process. And I'd say that's not just appointed here in the U.S., but we have pipeline and appointments in -- around the world. Germany is a very advanced market in this space, Canada, Australia.

0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,neutral,0.0376,0.033,0.9294
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Eric, a follow-up -- a couple of follow-up questions on the balance sheet. Noticing that the investment portfolio was smaller on both period-end and average, but you had a good amount of deposit growth, so it seems like you actually have more cash sitting around today. Is that -- how do you contemplate that going forward? And are any changes in terms of how you reinvest built into your NII outlook?",neutral,0.0783,0.0407,0.881
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Ken, good question. We always have to be mindful of the balance between NII growth driven by the investment portfolio and the amount of AOCI risk that we take, especially now that we're in a place where rates are likely to either stay flat or rise. And the question is, are we going to get a rate shock or not. So we just need to be careful of that. 
We took a little bit of duration off the table in the first quarter as rates rose. Remember, naturally, our MBS duration will lengthen. And so that was one of the reasons we shortened up is just to protect against that. And I think the team that we had did quite a nice job of doing that early in the quarter, and protected some of what we wanted to around AOCI here. 
It does put us in a position where we have some cash that we can put to work in the coming quarters that is included in our -- in the outlook that I gave and it will provide a partial offset to the long-end rate downdraft that we continue to see. But we are also at the point where the investment portfolio was resized relative to a year ago by a solid 10% larger. We did that. But it does need to have a -- there's a certain capacity that we can run. And it's in the right range, though we may -- we will had a little bit, adjust a little bit trade around the edges to make the most with what we have.",positive,0.6041,0.0286,0.3672
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. And to that point, you did mention the episodic increase in RWA. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how much of a weight was that on the 10.8% CET1? And I think you mentioned getting back above the target range, so just -- does that come back? And just wondering if this -- how much of an anomaly were the ratios this quarter outside of what we saw in OCI.",neutral,0.3156,0.0746,0.6097
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. The episodic items that I mentioned, two of them were worth about 0.5 point of CET1. So all else being equal, we printed 10.8%. We would have printed 10.2% or 10.3% if they hadn't flowed through. And I mentioned those because, in fact, that's why we have buffers. That's why we have ranges. It's kind of part of what we need to operate around and always flag if they come in a little heftier, which might occasionally push ratios down a bit; or lighter, which sometimes happens as well, which will push ratios up and that's fine. These are just pretty typical overdrafts occasionally spike up, and you spike up overdrafts $2 billion to $3 billion. On the base of our balance sheet, that adds 0.25 point of the CET1 impact. 
And then the other one is the FX book just by nature of it having a sort of derivative positions when the dollar is in the money, strongly, we end up because the book is hedged. We have liabilities and assets in that book. We, in this case, as the dollar strengthened, we ran positive mark-to-market. But that has a -- that gets weighted heavily by the RWA standardized rules. And so you kind of had 4 -- $3 billion to $4 billion RWA move, which actually literally has remediated back over the last 2 weeks as the dollar move the other -- in the other direction. So anyway, just part of running the business and we'll always have some of this volatility. But at this time, it costs us about 0.5 point on CET1, and we -- it's reversed since.",neutral,0.1373,0.1186,0.7441
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0352,0.0614,0.9034
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Just curious on the servicing, the outlook. It seems as though there's some -- I know that this is an imperfect way to model, but it's the only way we got. It seems as though there's a decent amount of B-rate compression or the relationship of AUC and AUM to revenues seems to be with revenues lagging given the outlook here. And when you look at the full year, it almost suggests as though that will remain intact for the rest of the year. 
Is there anything specific going on? Does your outlook assume a normalization in the volume-driven components of the servicing fee piece that could be a bit of a headwind to that rate? Or is there some mix going on that's adverse? If there's any additional color you can give, that would be really helpful.",neutral,0.0743,0.2958,0.63
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure. Brennan, I think the biggest thing that's happening right now is that as AUC/As rise very significant due to equity markets and actually are offset a little bit by lower bond markets that we have that anomalous fee rate impact just because it's not a point-for-point change. Remember, every 10 points of change in AUC/A effectively drives a -- if it's driven by equity markets, a 3-point increase in servicing fees, right? It's that different, which means the fee rate just naturally and just mathematically comes in lower. It's not like the asset management business where it tends to almost be percentage linear, where 10% and 10% have played through between AUC/A and servicing fees. 
So I think that's the biggest item that plays through if we look at first quarter to first quarter, the year-on-years. And you'll see that for the rest of the year. So I'd just be very careful about that just mathematical result. 
I think if you step back and open up the lens on servicing fees, and I think you saw we had a good result this quarter sort of seeing fees up 7% year-over-year, nominally, 4% adjusted for currency translation. I guided in second quarter that servicing fees, again, would be in that 7% to 8% range. There'll be a few points of currency translation that again, but that's still a very healthy growth rate. 
A lot of that, most of that is driven by the equity market appreciation offset by some of the bond markets, and that's part of our business model. That's always part of our business model. And when equity markets are going south, it's part. And when they're going up, it's part. So that's the large driver right now of the revenue growth, and we think that at these levels of equity markets that we're at, we've got a strong set of year-on-year comparisons that we expect for second quarter and then you can -- we could model out for the year.",neutral,0.1299,0.06,0.8101
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. Okay. And then when we think about the -- there's this kind of a little bit of a struggle to me because I know we talked a lot about NII and the outlook. I'm going to beat this dead horse a bit. There was the update that was just sort of late in the quarter in March that seemed to suggest that things were going a little better and maybe we were getting to an inflection on NII. And then the guide here more suggests that there's plenty to offset those green shoots. 
So what changed in the -- either the portfolio or in the market that would cause the delta in between the intra-quarter update and here? Because it -- LIBOR is clearly a problem, right? Short rates are -- they matter to you all, and it seems like that's what's holding back some of the more constructive dynamics we're seeing at the long end of the curve. But it seemed like we knew that when we heard the update. So was there something that happened behind the scenes that maybe we weren't aware of that could have had the outlook maybe take a little off of the outlook or make it a little bit less constructive?",neutral,0.1107,0.3161,0.5732
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brennan, good question. I appreciate your being candid and direct. I think two things happened exogenously that mattered since the beginning in March when we stirred up the numbers and now. First is we've seen the short rates persist at a much lower level. And so I think when we were here early March, where we're going to have 1-month and 3-month treasuries sit at 4 basis points for the rest of the quarter, rest of the year, or were they going to bounce back? And they've clearly sat here or been weighted down. 
So I think that cost us about $5 in first quarter and relative to where we would have been cost us effectively another $5 in 2Q, which means kind of $10 cumulatively in 2Q, $10 in 3Q, $10 in 4Q. So that's not a -- I think that's not a welcome development. Now if they bounce back, we'll have some upside, but that's real. 
And then the other one that we're, I think, all just careful about is the attenuation of the MBS premium amortization. And I think you've seen a number of commentators talk about that around the industry. The last print that we all saw from the -- from Fannie, Freddie, had a small acceleration of prepayment rates instead of a downtick. And I think most of that was modeled then by folks. But it's hopefully the last gasp on prepayment as rates have boomed up, and now we're in burnout mode. 
But I think that slight 1 month that I'm fairly confident will be 1 month, it will be a -- and it's industry-wide, it's in the Fannie, Freddie data. I think it's just a reminder that we don't -- aren't sure of the pace of the attenuation of the premium amortization in these MBS books that we all run. We just have to be careful. Obviously, if the burnout goes faster and premium amortization falls more quickly, let me tell you, I'll be the first to signal that because I, like you and many others, are looking for not only the stabilization and we're confident in the stabilization now. But I'd love to see better than stabilization. We're just not quite at that point yet.",neutral,0.1159,0.094,0.7901

10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Eric, can you share with us, obviously, prepandemic, State Street's balance sheet deposits roughly averaged about $175 billion, and now they're sitting around $247 billion in the current first quarter. And during this time, the Fed, of course, increased its balance sheet dramatically from about $4 trillion to over $7.5 trillion. They're going to continue with QE, as we all know, at least through the end of the year into next year at $120 billion a month in securities purchases. Can you share with us how are you guys calibrating what kind of deposit growth you're likely to see as the Fed continues with QE for the remainder of this year and into next year?",neutral,0.3555,0.0158,0.6287
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Gerard, it's Eric. I think that's the $64,000 question that many banks are wrestling with, especially as some of the rule changes happen for others on SLR and as we think about the leverage ratios. And clearly, we're in a new world. We had seen post the global financial crisis, the expansion of Fed balance sheet and then its recompression and now we're in a new era again. 
I think our general view is that the parts of the banking system will roughly track the Fed monetary policy expansion, so it will do so in waves. And I think we saw that in first and second quarter of last year, we saw quite an expansion. And then we saw some flatness in deposit balances. And then as the Fed buying, offset by some of the compression in the treasury's own portfolio, we saw some further uptick. And we've seen that again this year. 
I think we do expect continued expansion. Because we expect continued expansion of the Fed balance sheet, we do expect that to come back to banks. And I think from our standpoint, what we're trying to do is be open for business for our clients, and we'd like to do that every day of the week because that's important to them. And we've got some capacity to accommodate some of this growth as it comes. It's not infinite capacity, but we've got some capacity. 
And then what we'll have to do is if the Fed balance sheet goes up another 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, we have to see when they are going to start to constrain their own bond-buying activities, slows down, pause, et cetera, we will, at the right time, to have to just work on some of our discretionary pools of deposits. We have those, and we have some capacity to adjust. We've got a suite of options for clients. We -- our deposit rates are at 0 or near 0. 
So for clients, we can certainly facilitate other activities at the right point. That's not for today or tomorrow or next quarter necessarily. It's -- but it's in a year or 2 that comes, right? We can help them sweep to money market funds. We can help them sweep to -- with treasury securities. We can help them sweep into the repo business. And so we'll have to just navigate through. We feel pretty comfortable where we are today and in the next quarter or 2. But we'll just have to see if there's a wave, we'll address, and I think we'll just have to navigate through.",neutral,0.2027,0.0254,0.7719

45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Gerard, there is some good disclosure in some of the post quarter-end LCR type information that we and all the banks share. And we can -- I think I can ask the IR team to point your analysts to that. It gives different types of deposits, and it gives different kind of those different liquidity values, which starts to get at some of what you're describing around operational versus nonoperational, so we can follow up with you.",neutral,0.1381,0.016,0.8459
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Great. And then as a follow-up question, you guys are not big lenders. I understand that your loan portfolio relative to your total assets is -- or deposits is obviously quite low. But I did notice that the average loans in the quarter were down, but period-end, quarter-to-quarter, were up, I think, 13%.

45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. We're always getting a little bit of volatility. I think one of the -- well, one of the things that we have is just overdrafts are coming through as a loan, right, as part of the book, so that's one. And I mentioned how that had a spike up at the end of the quarter. 
The other one is there's a good part of our loan book is the private equity firm capital call financing that we do. And that's had a nice trajectory earlier in the quarter. We just have a bit of a seasonal effect and then late in the quarter, we've -- as we've seen these funds start putting more and more capital work, we'd start to have draws on those loans, and those have started to up the -- those draws have added to the balances in a nice way, and that's one of the reasons that we have -- we see some good continued growth in lending for us.",positive,0.6513,0.0465,0.3021

18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"I had a big picture question and specific question. I guess let's go with the big picture first. Originally, you were talking about converting SSgA to Charles River, and that would be a flagship client that you could use to sell to other asset managers. Is that still something that's contemplated, that's proceeding? Do you have a time frame for that? How is that looking?",neutral,0.0472,0.0193,0.9336
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes, Mike, that's underway. And it's proceeding exactly the way I would describe it. It's a big complex project, so it's been a good one to -- I mean it was client number one. We've obviously got a lot of other clients since then, some of them much simpler and less complex. But yes, it's very much underway and on track.",neutral,0.2294,0.0227,0.748
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"Okay. Okay. And then just more generally, as it relates to -- you said new business is neutral. And is that just the environment? Because of the pandemic, it's tougher to knock on doors? Or is that execution that you'd like to see improve? Now you have talked about the coverage model expansion and I guess there is a -- it takes time to get that. But when you talk internally, do you say, ""Well, it's the pandemic. It's been tough to get new customers."" Or do you say, ""No, you have to do better. We're raising the bar. We're raising the intensity.""",neutral,0.2553,0.0313,0.7133
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. Mike, we've been very open on this with you over the last few quarters. It's the latter. Much of the natural growth in this industry is not there any longer, right? If you go back 10 years ago, more than that, much of the growth would be existing clients doing -- opening new funds, opening new fund ranges in different parts of the world. A lot of that is already accomplished. And in many cases, you're seeing fund closures, right, as every distributor is narrowing their range. 
And there's a desire for less choice, not more choice. So it absolutely is about increasing intensity, and we're starting to see that pay off. We talk a lot about Alpha, but the way to think about this is Alpha and front-to-back as an and, not an or, right? We still have an existing core business in which we see opportunity to increase penetration, increase penetration in medium-sized asset managers, to continue to grow what we're doing with asset owners and insurance companies. So it's very much about the latter with the Alpha, particularly as we continue to land new assignments and install those as being able to provide yet a little bit more growth over the medium to long term.",neutral,0.1976,0.0153,0.7871
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"And then lastly, I guess, are you nearing the bottom to -- for the NII and the fee waivers? I guess, NII, so your guidance is just a little bit lower than it was in the first quarter, right? It's not falling off the cliff from -- unless I'm reading something wrong, and the fee waivers net $40 million worse ahead. Just if you could just clarify one more time on the NII and fee waivers? And when do you think we hit bottoms?",negative,0.0467,0.5034,0.4499
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Mike, it's Eric. On NII, I think the second quarter is the bottom, and that's why I've said likely to be at $460 million to $465 million per quarter for the rest of the year. So I think we've -- we're at the stabilization level, plus or minus a few bucks in that, in and around that range. And given what we know today, so we think that we're there, we're confident we're there. And now the question is how long is it flattish at that level? And then when does it pick up in that? I think we'll know more in the coming quarters. 
And on the fee waivers, what we've done is forecasted what they'd be for second quarter, the net 40-ish or so offset by balances versus the net 15-or-so from first quarter. But that's predicated on short rates being where they are today, and they've been kind of flattish the last 30, 45 days, and -- but that's the assumption. We're obviously hoping short rates stay flat or actually move up, that's supposed to go the other way. And so it's just based on that.",neutral,0.1286,0.1208,0.7506

22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"On the call in January, you talked about addressing sales to midsized asset managers. And so can you talk about some of the key differences and maybe challenges between selling to a large asset manager and selling to a midsized one? And then I appreciate that it's pretty early in that, but any update on your progress in that part of the market would be helpful, too.",neutral,0.1418,0.0273,0.8309
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Rob, a couple of things on this. Part of the sale to a medium-sized asset manager is a whole lot more standardization. It's not to say that they don't need customization, but we're -- much of our success over the years was built around servicing very large asset managers. So much of what we've been doing has as much to do with standardizing the product as it does around adding to sales and coverage capabilities. 
But at the same time, we've recognized that how you sell and service to them, including having a way to scale up service in such a way that they're receiving the appropriate amount of service, but at a cost to serve that works for us. And again, that has required us to, in effect, establish a parallel model here and to make sure that we're delivering expected service that we're doing it in a way that can be done at the right unit cost for us. So -- and that work is underway. This is not a -- I mean, we've talked to you about this on a new problem. 
And at the same time, what we also want to be able to do is there's many firms at that median level, that either through their sophistication, through their range of products actually do need and can tolerate pricing was a bit of a higher service model. So a lot of this is about really understanding and segmenting the client base and getting our clients into the right bucket, if you will, and making sure that they truly are satisfied based on what their needs that they're not underserved and they're not overserved.",neutral,0.1332,0.0187,0.8481
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"That's really helpful. And then earlier this year, too, you announced an expansion of business in Latin America.

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Well, historically, you've seen a lot of our growth come from outside the U.S. Very relatively little of it, though, from Latin America. I mean part of it has been we haven't had as much coverage there as we've had elsewhere. We actually have a small but very loyal client base there. We've put a few people. This is not a massive investment on our part, but we've put a few very skilled veteran people covering that market now, and we're already seeing some really attractive green shoots. 
So we see this as a medium to long-term opportunity. Activity is already happening, even though we're less than a year into this intensified effort. And so we see it as a nice supplement to what we already have in place in EMEA and APAC.",neutral,0.3564,0.0132,0.6304

48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes, Vivek, it's -- I would describe it as -- idiosyncratic is maybe the best way to describe it. It was an extremely large client, a corporate pension fund and was doing what a lot of corporate pension funds are doing these days, right, derisking. So move from quite high up on the fee schedule to a much more of a derisked environment as a result of their asset allocation. I mean that's a trend that we've been seeing.

Eric, one for you, just a follow-on to an earlier question on NII given that you've seen a lot of growth in your liquid assets and your securities on an average basis were flattish linked quarter. What level of rates do you want to see before you're willing to move some of this liquidity into higher-yielding securities? Or is there something else that would drive you to do that? Or...",neutral,0.1057,0.021,0.8734
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"There really -- Vivek, it's Eric. There really 2 -- probably, 2 or 3 triggers or break points for us. I think one is the outright level of rates in -- we've seen some good movement in 10s, we've not seen that much movement in 5s. And so the question is a little bit, when does the curve more broadly move because we -- while we'd like to put more money to work, we need to be a little careful of our duration because with duration comes AOCI volatility. 
And so it's actually a mix of a higher curve in the belly of the curve that would be good to see. And right now, 5s are in the, whatever, 85, 90 basis point range. It'd be nice to see them a good bit higher. And 10s, for 10s to pay off, either in clean duration treasuries or in MBS, we need higher rates, a good bit higher before where we want to make that trade. At the right levels of higher rates, you get the benefit if rates were to come down off a positive AOCI, so that's helpful. 
But we're not at that level where we -- everything great is going to come back down very quickly. And so we actually need more of an upswing before we really lean into the trade. It doesn't mean we won't trade around the edges and trade the slope and so forth, but that's probably a little bit of framing that might help.",neutral,0.1422,0.0463,0.8115

45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Vivek, this was a legacy matter that dates a number of years ago. There were some costs that we, at the time, thought were reimbursable that were by either clients or other partners that we had. They did accumulate on the balance sheet, and we came to the conclusion recently that they're not reimbursable. And so effectively, they need to be expensed, and so we cleaned up the books here. But it dates back a number of years, and we made the adjustment accordingly.

You can look at it when you lay it alongside our other competitors just in terms of the R&D and the software development we've put into it. 
In terms of the new business achieved, it tends to be a mix. In many cases, it's replacing either proprietary OMSs or risk analytics systems or systems that were put in that really aren't being supported anymore. That tends to be most of it. And I think that tends to be most of it for our big competitors. There's a little bit of takeaway going on, typically, when somebody is doing some consolidating, but it's not so much takeaway as it is replacing something proprietary or something that's just no longer being supported.
