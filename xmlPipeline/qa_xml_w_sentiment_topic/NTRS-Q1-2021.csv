0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,neutral,0.0457,0.0278,0.9265
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"I guess my question is on organic growth. I heard a lot of commentary throughout your 18 minutes of prepared remarks. On positive net flows, across most parts of the business. I think in your prepared remarks, I heard you talk about ESG mandates within asset management, but maybe you could cover whether you quantify or qualify, I'll take either one, where you're seeing new business, what kind of business you're winning in asset servicing? And has there been any pandemic-related pause that is now freeing up a lot, Jim. So any color on that would be great?",neutral,0.148,0.0128,0.8392
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. Mike, do you want to start on it?",neutral,0.0326,0.0364,0.9311
38,Michael G. Oâ€™Grady,,"Sure. So Glenn, as you described there, we are seeing strong organic growth across the company and specifically in asset servicing. And I would say the first place I would start, the foundation of our growth strategy is retaining existing clients. And as you would imagine, going through the pandemic, being able to support clients has been extremely important, but also, I think, earned us the right, if you will, to continue to serve our clients, many of them are largest clients. So that's been a big positive. 
Second, I would say is that we have seen, I would say, a full return to marketplace activity. So our clients, both asset owners and asset managers are actively looking at their own operating models and looking for opportunities either to become more effective in how they invest on behalf of their beneficiaries or improving the efficiency of the way they do that. So consolidating operations or providers, utilizing new technology, and that has played very well into our strategies in asset servicing that we've had underway for years. So thinking about things like front-office solutions, which is an investment book of record for clients that have high levels of alternative assets, the ability to look at across their portfolio in order to manage their business. And then thinking about our asset manager clients, our whole office strategy is definitely resonating as well where we can provide services across front, middle and back office. So high level of activity. And then I would say, success with strategies we've had in place for some time period.",positive,0.8147,0.0117,0.1737
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Appreciate that. Maybe just the last follow-up on net interest income. The NIM was down 5%, but deposits were up a ton. Do you feel net interest income has now finally bottomed and maybe some backup of your thoughts behind that in terms of redeployment opportunities?",negative,0.2067,0.5502,0.2431
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"I don't want to call a bottom on it. I mean, if you unpack the quarter effectively, we saw loan growth that was strong and up $1 billion, and that has a few million dollar impact if you take our average return on those assets. If you think anywhere from 175 to 200 basis points on that $1 billion, you're going to get $4 million or $5 million in lift for the quarter. And then you also had obviously a lift from the deposits overall, but that's offset by something that's more predictable going forward, which is we're still going to have reinvestment in -- as the security book continues to mature. And that's still got some maturation to do. And so it's easier to predict what's going to happen on the reinvestment side than what's going to happen on the loan side. But obviously, if we continue to see strong loan demand, then that's more important than what we're seeing on the other components of volume.",neutral,0.3321,0.0467,0.6212
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,neutral,0.0373,0.0369,0.9257
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"I see at your annual meeting today, a 2021 priority is productivity. So I was wondering if you could put some metrics around what you'd like to achieve? And on the positive side, I see the headcount is down 1% quarter-over-quarter. The pretax margin in the first quarter is back to the 30s, where it was not last year at all. But on the negative side, I have to imagine the fee waivers will continue and might actually increase. So where does it all end up? And where would you like to get to this year?",negative,0.0571,0.8287,0.1142
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. Let me take that in a few different buckets. You're right. The productivity is extraordinarily important. And we go and we scratch and call and do everything we can to earn new business. That's hard to do. It's not overly predictable. But what we can do is exhibit extreme discipline on the productivity side. And so we haven't put external metrics to that, but we're looking at it a lot of different ways internally. We look at operating leverage, which we talked about earlier, we look at fee operating leverage. And internally, we're able to look at organic trust fee operating leverage. And so from our perspective, we want to see -- we don't want to just call expenses up or down because a lot of our business relate -- a lot of our expenses relates to the amount of new business that's coming in. And if we continue to show growth in the different areas of the business, we're going to see lift in those expenses. We just want to make sure it's related in the proper way to the organic growth that's coming in. Now you're right, headcount was down. And that comes back to the initiatives that we talked about in January. And so you see it's a meaningful reduction for us of about 300 headcount and that played through in lower salary expense for the company. And so that's -- those are meaningful movements and I think reflective of the discipline and the commitment we have around expense management. And then on fee waivers, you're right, it's -- that is a -- it's a very, very difficult dynamic that we're facing. And I also think people need to realize, we've talked about the fact that the $50 million we have this quarter, we're still seeing lower rates on the short end of the curve. And as much as we've seen the 1-year, 5-year, 10-year up, we've seen overnight repo at 0 and 1, and that's very difficult for a $275 billion pool of money market funds. And that's why we've tried to give consistent information, not guidance, but a consistent run rate on how those fee waivers are going. And as we sit right now, that number looks more like $65 million to $70 million on a quarterly run rate basis. Hopefully, as the Fed balance sheet changes, we see some improvement there, but that's where we sit today. And so it's something we have to monitor. And obviously, it has a big impact on the pretax margin you identified.",neutral,0.1421,0.232,0.626
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"And then the one tailwind you have, I guess, the higher asset values. Can you remind us of the relationship between every change in the stock market and your fees?",neutral,0.0475,0.0483,0.9043
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. It's going to -- it varies by the area of the business that you're talking about. In general, 60% -- in C&IS about 60% are based on asset values in some ways. And then in wealth, you can split it even more. And Mark, you might have those numbers close or off the top of your head, but it's...",neutral,0.0435,0.0363,0.9202
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Right. Yes, the 60% in C&IS is related to asset values, which would be all asset values, equity assets as well as fixed income or cash. And then as we look across, in wealth management, there is more of a relationship there to the assets. But the equity sensitivity, if that's what you're looking at, is a little different. And the regions, the equity sensitivity is probably 50% to 55%, whereas when you get to the Global Family Office, there the equity sensitivity is probably closer to 1/3 just because of the way the clients' assets are allocated.",neutral,0.0618,0.0314,0.9069
0,Operator,,We will now go to Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0403,0.0134,0.9463
6,Brennan Hawken,,"So first on the balance sheet growth here. Quite robust deposit growth. It was a pretty significant inflection from how things were trending in the back half of last year. And so curious about your thoughts there? How much of this do you view as excess? It seems as though a lot of the central bank deposits on the asset side went up, which would imply that you might think this is -- these are short duration deposits. So if you could give maybe some color on what your expectations are for the sustainability of this growth in deposits and how you might be thinking about redeploying those deposits over time? And how much time do you need in order to do that?",neutral,0.123,0.0382,0.8387
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So you're right. I mean, total interest-related deposits up, interest-bearing deposits up. And I think the good news is that interestingly, we were able to hold on to the margin. You saw a decline in LIBOR. And even in that book, we also saw a decline in cost. And despite the fact that part of the book is below 0. And I think that's meaningful. To get to your question about volume levels and the nature of the deposits, there's no doubt a lot of those deposits are nonoperational. And so we need to let them season before we would do much beyond putting those at central banks. That said, there are other things we can do because we've got capacity in the balance sheet. But obviously, the nature of how we run the treasury book is to let those types of deposits, the ones that are more institutional and might be more transitional season before we would take longer-term exposure on those.",neutral,0.2467,0.1006,0.6528
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. All right. I appreciate that. And then when we think about -- I think you had had commented, Jason, in response to Glenn's question about that really, when you think about NII, it's a foot racing between loan growth and reinvestment rates. Your loan growth picked up a bit here this quarter versus the trend of the back half of last year. But period end, not necessarily all that higher than the average. So how should we think about loan growth from here? What are you seeing as far as demand for loans amongst your clients? And is the rate for that loan book still -- are we still better off looking at the 1-month and 3-month LIBORs to think about those rates?",neutral,0.1513,0.0722,0.7765
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So first of all, the loan growth has come almost exclusively or the vast, vast majority has come from the wealth management side of the business. And even though in dollars, it's not as big as the deposits, the impact is much more meaningful. And having $1 billion in higher average deposits, that's quite meaningful for NII, and we've talked very consistently about the fact that the deposit levels are interesting. They're chunky, but don't really do too much on NII. It is difficult to predict what the loan demand will be. However, what we've experienced isn't simply, I'd say, random. We've talked about the fact that we have been communicating with clients more aggressively. And this is over the last 1.5 years, 2 years, about our desire to be with them and be a liquidity provider for them. 
Our liquidity engagement with clients is it's a big part of our business. And that shows up not just in what we do with the balance sheet on deposits, but also money market funds where again, $275 billion in AUM there and also on the lending side, particularly on the wealth management clients. And so it's more -- this has been, I think, more of a strategic lift and -- so that's not predictive that it's going to hold on or continue to accelerate, but we don't see it as something that we're dismissing is potentially random either.",neutral,0.1253,0.026,0.8487
0,Operator,,We will now go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0361,0.0149,0.949
4,Alexander Blostein,,"I want to shift gears a little bit, maybe talk about capital a little bit, and obviously and continue to be in very strong position across all the key ratios. Can you guys remind us or kind of how you think about the binding constraints for Northern Trust, obviously, relative to regulatory minimums, that's not kind of how you said the bar. You typically look at your peers. So given some of the changes that they have made and kind of how they're thinking about sort of the minimum levels they're willing to run with, how does that inform your view of excess capital at Northern Trust? And then ultimately, how does that translate into your appetite for increased buybacks from here?",neutral,0.1032,0.0162,0.8806
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So you're right that it's less of a -- for us, it's less of an algebraic calculation and more where we want to be on a relative basis. At this point -- you guys have heard us talk consistently about -- thinking about our engagement with the Board where we're totally aligned, but we want to make sure that, that conversation continues to take place where we are on an absolute basis, how we think about things on a relative basis and how we think about things from a regulatory perspective. 
And right now, I'd say, just keeping an eye on what the industry is doing is important. So the absolute level, less so, we got plenty of room, obviously, from a CET1 perspective, sitting at 12%, given where the regulatory minimum are. And so if you think about Tier 1 leverage, even though the industry has talked about coming down significantly, we're -- we've still printed well into the 6s. And that's on a $125 billion average deposit base. So I'm not going to -- I'm not giving you our buffers here, but just take a 5% number just to get at your question on about what our capacity would look like. If you came all the way down to 5, that would translate to a balance sheet of about $200 billion, and you could have $170 billion in deposits, all else equal on the balance sheet today. And so you're talking about easily $40 billion on a base of 125 currently. And so that's a lot of room. And I think also importantly, it's not like we use the balance sheet for clients that for organizations we don't know. We're really dealing from a candidate pool of depositors that are existing clients. And so at this point, we feel good about the capacity we have, but it's obviously something that we're watching, given how dramatically things can change given Fed actions and where deposits were 15 months ago.",neutral,0.0774,0.0433,0.8794
4,Alexander Blostein,,Right. I guess I was trying to get more to the capital return framework of kind how you guys are thinking about the opportunity for share repurchases from here given the access capital that you've outlined?,neutral,0.0737,0.0173,0.909
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Thanks for clarifying. Let me tackle that directly. It's interesting because this quarter is a great example of how -- we don't just think about do we buy back stock or not. There are different ways we can invest capital. And that 10% to 15% return target, it comes up in everything we do from a capital perspective, including using the balance sheet to help clients. And so this quarter, you saw the capital levels come down not because there was a meaningful decline in CET1, but because there is more activity in -- from a client perspective, and that showed up with an increase in RWA on the denominator. And we saw higher sec lending activity. We saw higher lending activity and we saw higher treasury activity in the form of more bond buying, muni purchases. In each of those areas, we're thinking about what's the best way to use our balance sheet in the long run and what's the best way to think about return. And for us, we can think about the returns of buying back $1 of stock. We're looking at everything from what we think our returns are going to be there, what's -- what are we getting in terms of price to book. We're also looking at the desire to be there with clients and what those returns will look like. And when we have the ability to think about lending or expanding C&IS relationships with the other things I mentioned, those things come up as very attractive ways for us to use capital. It turns into better -- it turns into good growth for us in the long run and good use of capital.",neutral,0.3227,0.2291,0.4482
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. Great. That makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up around NIR again. So I think, Jason, in the past, I think we talked a little bit about some sensitivities to sort of the repricing dynamics in the securities portfolio. Maybe refresh us where that sort of stands today? So securities portfolio yield, I think, is about 120 or so. If you look at rates where they are today, I want to say most of the securities portfolio is already repriced lower, but holding current rates constant sort of how much more of a drag on the securities yield do you guys expect to see over the next couple of quarters?",negative,0.0588,0.5698,0.3714
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. Well, to give you a sense of what's repriced at this point, obviously, just take -- if you look at the $150 billion in earning assets, obviously, all of the money market assets have repriced, 85% of the loan book is repriced. It's $60 billion of the securities. So about 63% of the securities book has repriced at this point. So that's where we sit at this point. And then it's interesting, if you think about what's the impact of that, I'll tell you, in this quarter alone, it was a significant impact. We actually had, if you -- just from securities portfolio, NIR was down $10 million. And so that was the drain on it. But that's not -- I don't want you to think about that as a pure run rate because we're thinking there about what's happening with the loan book and so there are other factors to play in as we're reinvesting those securities. But I want to at least start with giving you the numbers that you asked for in terms of how much is repriced and then also what the implications are. But the runoff is coming through at this point. And also the fact that the 1, 2, 3, 5 year where we tend to be reinvesting has come up, that has brought down the influence on a quarter-over-quarter basis as well.",neutral,0.0551,0.3921,0.5528
0,Operator,,We will now go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0352,0.0165,0.9483
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"If I can start off with maybe one of the loan book, Jason, just -- the comment you made on the 85% of the loan book has repriced. It looks like that yield has at least for the last couple of quarters now bottomed and it's starting to move back up. So my question would be around of the 15% that's repricing, sort of what are the dynamics on that versus maybe what are some of the new loans that you're bringing on that's helping improve that yield? And then longer term, most of that is tied to LIBOR. Maybe just talk about the plan of whether some of those loans are going to use in new reference rate given the planned station of LIBOR and how you're thinking about that?",neutral,0.0839,0.0875,0.8285
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So the longer-dated loans are -- often it's going to be in the mortgage book. And so that's what's going to take longer effectively, just so you know. The loans that have come on disproportionately, the growth has come, again, within wealth, but within personal loans and within some of our more corporate-based organizations, we do have a lot of corporate -- there's small and midsized business activity in that book, and that's where a lot of the growth has been. And then in terms of the LIBOR transition, yes, as you know, and I'm sure you're covering really closely, Brian, there'll be a transition in most -- the industry seems to be looking to move from LIBOR to SOFR as a reference rate. And so watching that and the implications of it.",neutral,0.0723,0.0228,0.9049
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"And is that transition to SOFR, I mean, I guess it's too early at this stage because there's not an effective term rate. But I mean, is there any -- or are you sensing any implication on the yield of the loan book by that transition? Or is it just simply too early?",neutral,0.0324,0.2595,0.7082
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Well, it's early, but we -- and I think the industry is hoping that they'll be -- once we get to those transition dates, they'll be more of a reset and we'll have the -- not just the reference rate changes, but the spread changes. And to reflect -- because, obviously, SOFR is different. There's not credit, there's not duration in it. And so it's a different rate. And the relationship between LIBOR and SOFR is a lot different today than what it was even a year ago. And so I think the industry has got some work to do to work on what the conversations are going to be like at the point where we actually make that hard switch.",neutral,0.0939,0.0358,0.8704
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,neutral,0.04,0.0367,0.9233
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"So I had a couple of ticky-tack modeling question. The first is just on the non-asset sensitive fees within custody and fund administration. And we've had 2 pretty meaningful sequential increases these past 2 quarters. That line item exited the quarter at about $178 million versus what historically had been a pretty consistent range of $150 million to $160 million. I'm just curious what's driving the recent strength in that line item? And maybe just as we think about from a modeling perspective, what's the right jumping off point we should be thinking about as we look ahead to 2Q?",neutral,0.2211,0.0533,0.7257
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Yes. And just to make sure I'm tracking totally specific, you're talking about other noninterest income at $180 million on the income statement?",neutral,0.0271,0.0416,0.9312
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"It's actually the $178 million within custody and fund administration, but it's a non-asset sensitive fee portion. So that's the part that will presumably move around with that?",neutral,0.0325,0.0355,0.932
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Yes. So this is Mark. So you're referring to when we talk about the sensitivity of the -- of those fees at about 60% to 65% are asset sensitive, and then the rest are kind of either their mix. Quite frankly, there's transaction volumes within those. There are some flat fees or fixed fees or even account level fees. So you could maybe say roughly half of it is transaction volume related. So -- and we did see a pickup this quarter in those transaction volumes that created some of the sequential lift that we saw -- or 1% or so of the sequential lift that we saw. So I hope that is answering your question?",neutral,0.1696,0.0589,0.7715
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"Yes, yes, that's sufficient. So we should be expecting some normalization of that, presumably it could be higher than the $150 million to $160 million, but it sounds like the $178 million may have been a bit elevated and we could see some rebasing there. Is that fair?",positive,0.641,0.0542,0.3047
34,Mark M. Bette,,"Yes, that's probably fair. I don't necessarily have the numbers that you're doing because I don't have it on specifically like that. That's kind of a directional guide that moves around each quarter that split. But yes, I mean, we did -- we certainly saw heavier transaction activity during this most recent quarter that would have benefited those fees by a bit.",positive,0.7015,0.1719,0.1266
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"Okay. That's helpful color. And just for my follow-up on NII, actually, a bit more focused on the liability side. The beat was helped by continued grind down in those interest-bearing deposit costs. It's the second consecutive quarter where we've actually seen that come down. Just curious if you see any additional room to cut deposit costs further if the rate backdrop folds or has that lever been largely exhausted at this point?",negative,0.0702,0.8639,0.0659
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"I felt decent about coming down a couple of basis points in that book. And I think it's reflective that a lot of that book is international. It's in currencies that are already used to having negative rates. And so the dynamic that we've talked about that once 0 is broken, there's an expectation that the beta will continue at that point seems to be playing through there. And so wouldn't necessary -- and we've talked to clients a lot about where rates are there because it obviously can be a sensitive topic. But I think the win there is we've got good dialogue with clients that indicate we're all looking at things like the euro the same way and tracking deposit costs. So we don't have further deterioration as the asset side compresses more.",neutral,0.218,0.2148,0.5672

40,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Just a question on organic growth trends. You provided some good color on asset servicing in the loan book question. Just in investment management and particularly in wealth, are you starting to see improvement as COVID conditions improve versus last year? And how has the competitive backdrop changed given that it seems like everybody has been focused on that part of the business?",neutral,0.4273,0.0261,0.5466
38,Michael G. Oâ€™Grady,,"So in wealth, we've continued to grow. But you're right, the marketplace is extremely competitive, which is why it's so important that we stay focused on both the parts of the market where we think we compete most effectively, and on providing for the clients in that segment. So where we're seeing our strongest growth has been in the upper part of the market there. So think about clients with assets above $20 million. And particularly during this time period where equity values are going up, there's obviously been an increase in wealth. So that drives growth. But then also with the change in administration and potential changes in taxes and things like that, it increases the need for planning. So a high level of activity, both with our existing clients, but also opportunities with prospects.",positive,0.8298,0.0193,0.151
40,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the expense outlook, you realize you guys try to focus on aligning that slightly lower than the organic growth levels that firm over time. But as we transition from, say, the low short rates as headwinds to NII and waiver headwinds stay eventually stabilizing and then as short rates rise and eventually become still, like any necessary like investment areas ahead or like new efficiency areas post-COVID like real estate that we should be thinking about?",neutral,0.1271,0.0167,0.8562
38,Michael G. Oâ€™Grady,,"I'll start, and then I'm sure Jason can add detail to it. But it's -- on the expense side, it's a very dynamic situation right now. What I mean by that is we're obviously still in this resiliency mode that we talked about, which has certain, say, cost to it, but also there are certain expenses that we're not incurring at this point. So obviously, travel and business promotion is lower than it was pre-pandemic. With not operating with as many people in our facilities, the cost of operating those facilities is lower. So you do have some lower costs on that front that to the extent that we transition out of that, you would expect that those would increase. 
The second thing I would say is with regard to the organic growth that we've talked about, it does require investment. That can be supporting large new clients. And it also can come in the form of bringing on new talent to continue this growth. I mean as you bring on new talent, you want to make sure that you're providing the right level of service across all of our businesses, and that means making sure that we have the people that go along with this. And then the third piece I would just say is around our digitalization efforts, which, again, have accelerated in the last year. And I think we're seeing the benefit of that. But it does require investment in technology as well to ensure that, yes, we're adding those capabilities, but we're doing it in the right safe, secure, stable way. So that backdrop does say, okay, we're going to continue to grow, but it's going to require investment. And that's why, as Jason talked about earlier, we also have to be focused on efficiency. And we did see, as a part of the remote working environment, there are some efficiencies in that as well. And so how can we, for example, look at our real estate footprint and see if there are opportunities to shrink the footprint and use that to support some of the investments that I talked about.",neutral,0.2723,0.0895,0.6381

And so we were able very quickly to take those discussions and have virtual conversations. But with that same very -- what we think is a very differentiated platform with clients through COVID, it was very good. Engagements were very, very strong, and it's led the business to feel that there's strong momentum from an overall client engagement perspective. So that's gone well. And it's one of the continued large investments in wealth management. And Mike just talked about our investment in digitizing the business. That's an area where we can use that as a core platform but add journeys to it, add specific areas to become more and more detailed and specific with how -- matching up with what our clients are going through. It's very strong investment for us, and it's been extremely positive. Our Net Promoter Scores as Steve Fran, who runs that business is just talking about how strong those are.

And then just separately, I know you've been in the press recently with regard to some of the crypto custody activities that you are working on, not sure when it's going to be launched. I think you've got a partnership going on with [indiscernible]. So maybe you can give us some color on that. And part of the question too is, it doesn't just end with custody or can you foresee an opportunity to enable -- to offer crypto to your clients? 
When I think about European investors, well, not just investors, but the services asset managers that you work with over there are dealing with negative rates. What I hear is that there's a decent demand for going into crypto because at least it's not negative interest rate. So how far is it until you -- or how long is it until you offer crypto as one of your liquidity tools? Just kind of thinking, thinking out loud.",neutral,0.0892,0.0507,0.8601
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"So Betsy, as you know, the financial markets are constantly innovating and evolving, and have for some time period and in the business we're in, we absolutely have to keep pace with that, and do it in a way that, again, it allows us to provide the safety and security for the clients in managing their assets. And crypto and digital assets more broadly is right now, clearly, one of the areas that's evolving the fastest. And so on that front, to your point, with regard to custody of crypto assets or cryptocurrencies, we've partnered with Standard Chartered in a venture called Zodia, which will provide that crypto custody. And I think what's important there, what we're trying to accomplish is leverage the traditional custody expertise that we have, that Standard Chartered has as well, but do it in a fintech way. So that's why it's a separate independent entity that, again, can develop and evolve at that pace. And at this point, we still expect at some point in 2021 that will be approved for client use. Again, it's going to be done not only our own, I'll call it, approvals, but also from a regulatory perspective. And then I think more broadly, to your point, absolutely, we see many different potential opportunities in this space where clients will look at digital assets and potentially cryptocurrencies in order to address various either challenges they have or ways to earn better returns. And that's why we've not only done what I talked about in cryptocurrencies, but more broadly with the digital assets, whether it's tokenization, which we've done with -- on the value, whether it's developing a PE capability on blockchain which we've done with Broadridge, there's a number of different areas where we've experimented either on our own or with partners in order to be able to be a part of that innovation.",neutral,0.1144,0.0142,0.8713

39,James Francis Mitchell,,"Maybe just a question on the wealth management business. It seemed to be quite a bit of disparity in the outcomes even though market appreciation, whether it's lag basis or month lag or full quarter lag, was pretty similar. So is it just -- there's a lot more fee waivers in the Global Family Office. How do we think about that sort of difference?",neutral,0.0469,0.0658,0.8873
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes, you've hit it right. There is a distinction in the lag in that business, but that's not what drove it, frankly. It was -- it's the waivers hit hard. And we've talked about the fact that people shouldn't see waivers as linear. This is a good example, where the waivers -- that the GFO business is obviously much more institutional. And so the waivers hit later. And we're now starting to see it come in, whereas the regions have more traditional closer to, but not retail pricing. And so those waivers just hit earlier. 
Second dynamic though is GFO is spiky. And we have clients there that will move billions of dollars. And so you can have 1, 2, 3 clients that if they all have significant movements, then you'll -- you can see big movements on a sequential basis. If you look year-over-year, the organic growth -- the growth rate overall for GFO is actually slightly higher than the regions. But obviously, the sequential look was impacted by those 2 things: one, waivers, and two, some spiky very large client movement.",neutral,0.1285,0.0679,0.8036
39,James Francis Mitchell,,"Okay. And so the incremental hit to fee waivers, is that also going to be in 2Q more in Global Family Office and maybe C&IS, or how do you think about the geography of that?",neutral,0.0419,0.0303,0.9278
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"I think we're -- I think from here, it's somewhat -- it's going to be more linear. I mean, the funds are more -- they're all there at this point in waiver mode. And so I don't think we're going to see as big of a disparity going forward. But people should just realize it's not a linear relationship. And I think there was -- overall it was $22 billion, $23 billion in wealth, and 9 of that was in -- 9, almost 10 was in GFO. And so that's a year-over-year look, that's just aggregate effectively. But the one quarter look, it was $5 million in GFO alone. And so big -- that was the increase quarter-over-quarter.",neutral,0.0624,0.073,0.8646

39,Jeffery J. Harte,,"To circle back a bit to the buyback. I mean, it's good to see you guys out there buying $135 million of stock. Historically, it feels like the actual buyback comes in kind of below what at least our estimated capacity is somewhat regularly. I think first quarter might have given us a partial edge with risk-weighted asset growth. But can you help kind of differentiate kind of the buyback, the difference in your thinking between just being conservative versus the expectation that risk-weighted assets could actually continue ramping up like they did in the first quarter?",neutral,0.3302,0.1871,0.4827
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. It's completely related, and it comes back to that theme of wanting to think about returns. And so -- and for us, it's not like we're making a decision of do we buy back stock or just park money at the Fed at 10 basis points. For us, we -- it's -- but it's nice to be able to see that client activity is driving the alternative to share buybacks. So that's certainly not to say that we're doing 0 or very little. It's just to say those are the different options we think about. And you saw sec lending activity up significantly. Just the loan demand being up $1 billion, that's going to cause $1 billion in higher RWA just in of itself. And then you see the deposits coming in, which is -- it's nice for us to be able to answer a client need, but that comes with RWA as we redeploy it on the asset side. And so the best thing we can do is have the balance sheet used for good return on equity activity that's client-related, building relationships in the long run. But at the same time, we did do $150 million in share repurchase over the time frame. So it's not like we were absent in the market, but you can imagine here at 12%, we're going to be looking at what does AOCI look like, what does client activity look like and balancing all of those things together.",neutral,0.1768,0.0288,0.7943
39,Jeffery J. Harte,,"Okay. And just to touch on kind of the fee growth, I guess, growth across relative businesses. It seems like C&IS has been outgrowing wealth management, at least outpacing it for a while now. I mean, is that the right way that we should think about those 2 business trajectories going forward growth-wise? Or is there a reason to think that kind of wealth management could start kind of catching up with C&IS?",neutral,0.2216,0.0148,0.7636
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Couple of things. One, every time -- over long periods of time, we think one of the businesses is growing faster and we think all this is going to be the case for the future, you get an inflection. The businesses have acted as good hedges to each other. And it's always difficult to predict those inflection points and what's going to grow faster. For sure, if you look over the last couple or few years, you'd see C&IS having grown faster. But in general, wealth has got good exposure to equity markets. And so -- and you also think over the long run, there's good title growth, particularly at the top end of the wealth market. And so those things should help as well. And so we wouldn't call a prediction necessarily on one of the businesses over the long run and the future growing faster.",neutral,0.2654,0.0174,0.7172
34,Mark M. Bette,,"And I would just add to Jason's comments. That's why we really like the combination of the 3 businesses. Not only is it complementary from a client perspective, but also from a financial perspective, they have different dynamics. So the asset servicing business, which has done a great job leading and growing at a high rate, it also requires resources to do that as we've talked about that and has different levels of volatility in the business, whereas in wealth management, very steady and at a high level of profitability and scalable. And then with asset management, again, very high level of operating leverage in the business. And as has been positioned over the last couple of years, for example, when you can get positioned in the right products, for example, in liquidity, and the markets go up, the liquidity goes up. Very strong increase in profitability for that and focus on other areas where we can have that same dynamic with ESG and quant.

22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"Question from me on organic growth. I think a year ago, the prospects for organic growth were probably more uncertain. And fast forward to today and your comments have been really positive. Coming out of 2020, do you see any new or different sources of organic growth that could maybe increase the long-term sustainable rate you think you're capable of achieving?",positive,0.4979,0.0131,0.489
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"I'll start, and Mike, I'm sure has some comments on this as well. And let's take those -- let's take the different businesses. In C&IS, we hinted even early today, the integrated trading solutions is something we talked about a little bit over the last few months. That's come through. That's part of the reason I think there's been that lift in brokerage commission income, done strategic things in foreign exchange and those aren't -- so it's not accidental, I think, that we've had lift in those areas. And then front office solutions is another area where we're trying to go to sophisticated clients and show the breadth of what we can do. 
In wealth management, the engagement there is around expanding and continuing to invest in goals-driven wealth management. And the growth we've had, particularly in the upper end, that product gets to -- we've thought so much about what $50 million, $100 million and hundreds of millions of dollar clients need in order to interact in a good holistic way and think we're set up well there. And then in asset management, $215 billion, I remember about 1.5 years ago, where we were on a liquidity perspective to now $275 billion And yes, there's been great growth in the industry, but they did a lot of hard things to get cutoff times done well to get to open a Northern Trust portal-- there's so many different -- to invest in the talent we have in that group. And then you think about our ESG and quant capabilities, ESG assets are over $130 billion now, great engagement in -- across the Nordics with very strong client base there and doing a lot with our ETF platform, including launching new products in Europe there. And so in each of the areas, I think there's good opportunity for us to leverage the work that's been done to lead to stronger organic growth",neutral,0.3978,0.0123,0.5899

16,Vivek Juneja,,"Okay. All right. I'll follow up maybe a little more offline. Going back to the capital question, Jason, Mike. So I hear you, you want to obviously -- you're thinking about client needs and all of that stuff. But even if we factor that in as we think about it, what level are you sort of comfortable running your various capital ratios at? Whether it's Tier 1 leverage or whether it's CET1? Is it a 10% or is it an 11%? Whatever the form it gets through, whether it's through loan growth, securities lending growth and/or buybacks, what is sort of that cutoff point below which you don't want to go?",neutral,0.0361,0.0392,0.9246
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"From our perspective, I think it still is going to depend on where the industry -- where are our peers. And regulators asking us to hold on to capital, to not buyback stock at that time. I don't -- we don't call an absolute level. We haven't talked about our buffers externally. Obviously, we're running significantly above any regulatory minimum. But we haven't -- and so we've got buffers that we use internally to manage that, not something we've talked about externally. But when we engage with clients, we want to be able to continue telling them that they've got -- they're interacting with a balance sheet that's strong on an absolute and a relative basis. And it doesn't have -- it's part of our strategic strength when we talk to clients. And a lot of institutions you think about, not just pension funds, but even sovereign wealth funds, if they're investing -- if they're depositing $500 million, $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion, they're not really depositing, they're lending to their banks at that point, and they want to be operating with institutions that are strong.

37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. Well, couple of things. I mean, you're right, we're not a prime broker. And so we're not providing the type of trading leverage to --  or alongside clients in taking positions is we're dealing with either our hedge fund clients or our family office clients. In the family office business, we have some loans, but those are much more of the loans that we see in the traditional wealth business, which are loans against investments that clients will have and long-term clients, they're not taking that type of exposure. And so the -- and the services that we provide for our hedge fund clients and our GFO clients, it's much more about asset servicing, asset administration, investment reporting. That's how we're going to market to deal with those types of clients.

It's an interesting nuance because we -- a lot of our clients on the hedge space, they actually are SEC registered and so we're used to dealing with them and helping those types of institutions on doing the reporting and administration that they need to do for their SEC registration material and engagement. And so that would be -- I don't think it's a monumental opportunity for us, we haven't talked about it that way, but certainly, we have that capability set and would be seen as a strong provider for hedge funds that we're looking to have more of a traditional investment reporting and overall fund administration engagement with their service providers.",neutral,0.194,0.0113,0.7947
