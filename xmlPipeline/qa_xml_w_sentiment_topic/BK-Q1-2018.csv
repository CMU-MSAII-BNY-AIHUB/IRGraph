0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.,neutral,0.0465,0.0235,0.93
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"So I noticed in the prepared remarks, in disclosure, you noted net interest revenue growth in every single business, obviously, rates were up, but it's also balanced growth. So we noted high deposit betas. I'm assuming that's going to stay given your mix of clients and business. So the question I have is, how much balance sheet growth is possible as you continue to have like really good capital return? Because that's what's -- that's going to help continuing to drive net interest revenue, right?",positive,0.8229,0.0162,0.1609
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, Glenn, it's Mike. Let me just give you a couple thoughts there, and then, hopefully, I'll answer the question. But as you sort of think about the first quarter, and we said this at Investor Day as well, so -- we saw deposit balances a little higher than we expected in the beginning part of the -- our first quarter and this has come back down to kind of where we expected them to be. And as we sort of think about the second quarter, all things considered, we still expect NIM to increase, and we would expect that even with the lower deposit balances, the rate of growth of NIR will be a little lower than the first quarter, but we still expect to be -- it to be pretty healthy versus the second quarter of 2017. So we still expect to see both of that happening. And I think as we build -- as we continue to build the franchise and bring on new clients, we would hope that our -- any of the decline we see in our balances as a result of rates rising would be more than offset or offset partially at least by new business coming in, and we have the room on the balance sheet to continue to do that.",positive,0.8771,0.0608,0.062
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Okay. I appreciate that. You mentioned the business wins, obviously, in tri-party and collateral management claiming as the balances grow. Business wins and losses in Asset Servicing, are we not going to get that anymore?",neutral,0.0689,0.0568,0.8743
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Well, yes -- no, we took that stat out because -- and we did -- and this came up a little bit at the Investor Day. And we agreed with the view that it just really wasn't a particularly worthwhile statistic. It's a gross number, not a net number. Our belief the way different people talk about it across the industry is very different, relative to timing, relative to -- is it custody, is it fund accounting, middle office, how you account it? And so our view is there just wasn't a whole lot of value in it, which we agreed with.",neutral,0.0645,0.075,0.8605

4,Alexander Blostein,,"I wanted to follow up on the discussion related to capital and the NPRs put out by the Fed. So in terms of, I guess, the excess capital dynamic, obviously, too early to really tell. But I was wondering if you guys think through the impact it could have on the business, particularly in the repo markets, which, I guess, has partially been somewhat constrained by the leverage requirement at the banks. A, I guess, do you think some of that could come back? To what extent you think that could help your tri-party repo business and if possible, I guess, break out how much of revenues you guys generated in tri-party repo to help us kind of calibrate what the upside could be?",neutral,0.1451,0.0343,0.8207
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, Alex, this is Mike. I think the impact on -- you'll get a better sense from the other banks in terms of exactly what the impact they think they will have, but you would think that given the constraints they are all under now, that you would see that have a positive impact on the repo market, which would then come back to us from a servicing perspective. To what extent? It's hard to know right now.",neutral,0.0823,0.0327,0.885
4,Alexander Blostein,,Any sense how much you guys generated in tri-party repo revenues currently?,neutral,0.0534,0.0209,0.9258
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"That's not something we disclose, but it's included in the Clearance and Collateral Management line that you see in the disclosure.",neutral,0.0261,0.0309,0.943
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got you. And then, just my follow-up secondly, just kind of going back to the Investor Day, you guys outlined a longer-term NIM guidance of 125 to 140. You're at 123 now. So seems like you're kind of there. Any additional clarity you guys can provide on the assumptions, I guess, underpinning the 125 to 140 in terms of the rate backdrop, the size of the balance sheet, the time frame of how you guys think you'll get to those levels?",neutral,0.0871,0.0159,0.8969
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. As you noted, we're pretty much on the bottom of that range as we speak. And so if rates continue to way the -- to increase the way the market expects, we would be getting into that range as we go out through the rest of the year. And as you know, there is a lot of dynamics that sort of play into exactly what the NIM will be in terms of deposit mix, the level and rates as you mentioned, but we would expect to begin to get into that range as we go out through the rest of the year.",neutral,0.1668,0.0234,0.8099
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. I mean, I guess, like there is a scenario where it will be above 140, just given there's still seems to be some runway on the rate side?",neutral,0.1759,0.0335,0.7906

7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Maybe if we can just go back into Asset Servicing, looking at it through the old way on the fee line of Asset Servicing, a very strong 10% growth year-over-year. Maybe, if you can just bifurcate that a little bit because if -- you're pulling the clearing and collateral out of that separately on the clearing and the Treasury Business. And if you can talk about -- maybe sort of qualitatively about the pipeline in Asset Servicing. I think you mentioned you're onboarding a new business from a large customer. If that's -- can you give a little more clarity on that and the timing of that?",neutral,0.1649,0.0114,0.8237
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. So as you sort of look at the Asset Servicing line back in the supplement, it's up 10% year-over-year as you sort of noted, Brian. So again, as you sort of think about the drivers of that, very consistent with what we talked about in general, about what's happening. So the market levels and currency sort of helped aid that as well as growth in our collateral businesses and then organic sort of flows into our existing client portfolios. So and then there is a little bit of seasonality that you see in the first quarter as you look at the sequential results from a few items. But for the most part, you're seeing the same drivers that we talked about in general across the firm.",positive,0.4965,0.0324,0.4711
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"And just keep in mind with business, there are different things that go into the revenue flow. The core custody, core fee-based business, obviously, is impacted by the level of the markets. Wins and losses, it's a slow, steady set of changes that happen based on what the trends are on wins and losses, so you're not going to see dramatic shifts there. And so one client coming on doesn't materially change the number in a quarter. But it does give you a point of view of what we're seeing in terms of wins and losses.",neutral,0.0496,0.1973,0.7531
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. And I think, as you think about the new business wins, we feel if we were to report a number, it would be pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last number of quarters. I mean, it was a little outsized at the end of last year, but otherwise, if you looked at the average across the previous quarters, it was pretty similar, and the pipeline still feels good.",positive,0.7868,0.04,0.1733
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"And we have more conversion from the T. Rowe Price deal still -- yet to come, and I think you mentioned the JPMorgan treasury business is still -- the majority of that yet is still to be transitioned. Is that correct?",neutral,0.052,0.0216,0.9263
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. Yes. Yes. A good number of the clients from JPMorgan have been converted already, but it's the -- a few of the bigger ones are coming between now and the end of the year.",neutral,0.3624,0.0193,0.6183
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Okay. And just on the expense control, very solid, obviously, in the quarter, better than expectations. As we think about, Charlie, your comments on investing in the business in the rest of the quarters, this year, do you think this type of expense level is sustainable for the rest of the year given that you still have some improvements in the cost base to make as well?",positive,0.8675,0.0098,0.1227
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes, well, I'm not going to give you a forecast on expenses beyond what we said at Investor Day, but what you saw this quarter was very consistent with our points of view on what we think we can produce. And so this quarter includes a fair amount of the additional technology investments, not all of it will be growing throughout the year. But we're very, very focused on continuing to build and increasing the operating margin, which means we should continue to see a tight control on expense. What that means for the actual number, again, away from the effect of currency, we're focused on it. And so I think everything I said there we continue to play out throughout the year.",neutral,0.4398,0.0202,0.5401
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0316,0.0284,0.94
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Charlie, at Investor Day, we talked a lot about organic fee growth rates, and I think you mentioned -- or was it organic revenue growth rates? I think you mentioned that the old days of 1% going to 1.5%. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how much of the revenue growth this quarter was organic?",neutral,0.0646,0.0254,0.91
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. I'm not going to talk about that. It's not something we're going to talk about every single quarter. We did that in Investor Day just to give you a sense of the way we look at it internally and what we are focused on driving. I think -- but you -- but when you look at some of the results that we see, whether it's security lending loans, what we saw in FX, what you see in the levels of AUC/A, and just our comments on growing the underlying client base and franchise, I think directionally what you see across the businesses is headed in the right direction. And I guess the -- and the last thing that I would say is, when we went through Investor Day, it was a very interesting experience quite frankly to watch people's reactions to us being very open and honest and disclosing things that I don't think anyone else has disclosed in the business. So that, again, you have the lens into how we're thinking about it, which from our perspective is a positive because we're focused on the things that we want to do better at and think we can do better. But overall, you'll see it in the actual operating metrics over a period of time. So directionally in the businesses, which have more -- quicker paybacks, a series of the markets-related businesses, liquidity and security lending, you saw franchise growth, and we're focused on delivering it in the other businesses, which have longer lead times as well.",neutral,0.2065,0.0163,0.7772
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Got it. Okay. And just obviously, revenue growth is very strong this quarter. It seems like you outperformed the 1.5% long-term average that you were talking to at Investor Day. I don't know if that's a fair conclusion from your perspective?",positive,0.5537,0.0911,0.3552
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. I think directionally, it's fair to say that there was higher organic revenue growth than we've seen in the past. We're not pounding our chests that we've declared victory here. I mean, this is the very beginning. And as I said, most -- the important parts of our business, Corporate Trust, Asset Servicing, continuing to build stronger flows in our Asset Management business, client assets in the Wealth Management business, those take time to build. And you're not going to see big movements several months into a process here. But directionally, we do feel very good about it.",positive,0.7293,0.0167,0.2541
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then, just separately, during the quarter, obviously, a lot of false story in the market, so if you could speak to, outlook -- if volatility pulls back a little bit and then separately on LIBOR, there was a lot of discussion on how you are positioned for the LIBOR moves that happened in the quarter and maybe you could speak to the impacts that had this quarter, so going forward is either the 1 and 3 months -- revert to the basis risk that had before or continue to widen out from here, we can get a sense of the impact on you guys?",neutral,0.0571,0.0504,0.8925
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, Betsy, this is Mike. So on the first part, on the volatility question. So in the first quarter, some of the volatility did impact and helped some of the volumes that we saw, particularly in Pershing, as Charlie sort of noted in terms of having one of our peak days in that business. So in some ways, volatility will be helpful, right, but there could be negative effects of that as well depending on how that impacts the overall market. So we'll see. I think on the second part of the question, in terms of how we're positioned vis-à-vis sort of LIBOR, we are weighted more towards -- we have more LIBOR-based assets -- short-term LIBOR-based assets than we do liability. So as LIBOR starts to move up, whether it's 1 or 3 month, it is sort of helpful for us relative to how we're positioned.",neutral,0.4043,0.0286,0.5672
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then, just lastly, you mentioned Zelle and some of the things you're doing to help connect people to that. Without having to directly invest in the Zelle backbone, I think that's what I heard, but can you give us some color as to, not only what you're doing but where you think the market is for that?",neutral,0.1027,0.0109,0.8864
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. I think, obviously, if I'm -- I presume everyone understands what Zelle is, which is the group that is owned by a series of banks that are building out the capabilities to leverage a real-time payments network. In order to participate in those capabilities, the institutions have to do a fair amount of work to integrate their technologies with those platforms. Not every bank wants to do that. Not every bank actually controls their own capabilities because some of it's outsourced. We -- those -- many of those banks are clients of ours in our Treasury Services business. So we have the ability to step in and provide a series of those services to help them get access to those networks. The real question over a period of time relative to what those capabilities mean is, will banks and others build out solutions that access the capabilities of these real-time networks so that product offerings become more attractive versus using ACH and other methods of payment today. That's something we and other financial institutions are very focused on. That will take -- that's not weeks or months, that'll evolve over the next couple of years, but those capabilities are better than what exists in the marketplace. And we're -- think of us as a facilitator for the financial institutions that don't have the infrastructure or can't spend on it to do their own direct integrations.",neutral,0.1074,0.0141,0.8785

12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"First question, I'd like to ask you about, seems like the Issuer Services business seems to be flattening out. Can you just talk about the 2 different pieces of that and whether or not you're seeing either better activity or just better new business start to come through? Is that a turn in that?",neutral,0.1442,0.0331,0.8226
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Ken, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. In the corporate -- in the Corporate Trust business, Charlie sort of highlighted a little bit in his remarks, but that -- we have seen some green shoots of organic growth there in the quarter. And as Charlie mentioned, that's a good positive trend that we're sort of hoping to build upon. I think on the DR space, we'll see sort of how it goes. I think there's lots of seasonality in those numbers, and lots of timing around when certain corporate actions and other activities sort of happening in that business. We're hopeful that we'll continue to have -- manage it as best as we can, and we still have a very strong market share in that business and continue to sort of win our fair share of things that come to the market, but it can move around quite a bit quarter-to-quarter.",positive,0.5366,0.0152,0.4482
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"There's no doubt. Listen to me, we talked last year about not winning several large deals, which I described and, I think, we described and that were very conscious on our part. So you wind up with the lapping effects of those. And the only thing I'd just go back and say on Corporate Trust for a second, again, we talked about this at Investor Day. When we say we're starting to see some -- these green shoots of growth, just to be clear, this is -- I mean, there is a very focused effort in Corporate Trust to -- for us to -- which we went through with new management placed to understand why we weren't being as successful in the business as we think we could have been. And so we made a series of changes there. I'd say we're extremely focused on the business, and we see a very heightened focus on our coverage, on our sales efforts with our -- some of our most important partners across the globe that actually help generate that business. And we're working on continuing to build our technology. So again, it will -- hopefully, if we're as successful as we think we can be, it will build over time. But it's a very conscious effort. It's not just us watching what's going on in the marketplace and feeling good in good times and bad in bad times.",neutral,0.1524,0.0175,0.8302
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Understood. And if I can ask a second one. Just mix of deposits that are denominated in non-U.S. dollars. Can you update us on like the size of that? And I know we're in a U.S. rate cycle, but with the balance sheet still also be rate -- positively rate sensitive, should we start to see non-U.S. Central Banks start to raise rates?",neutral,0.0809,0.0564,0.8627
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. On the latter part of the question first, euros becoming nonnegative, I think, would be helpful. So that would be a positive impact. I think there is a high probability that the Bank of England raises rates shortly. And so that will be sort of marginally positive. But the overall mix of the balance sheet hasn't changed much with still around 70% of it still in U.S. dollars with the remainder being outside the U.S.",neutral,0.4471,0.0325,0.5204

6,Brennan Hawken,,"Just a follow-up on that, the 70% deposits in U.S. dollar and the increase that we saw here this quarter, at least that came through on the average balance sheet. What sort of deposit beta would you say we saw here with the last Fed hike? And do you have any expectations for where that's going to continue to go from here?",neutral,0.1153,0.0295,0.8551
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Brennan, it's Mike. See, as we've said a number of times over the last year or so, we would expect that betas continue to increase as rates increase, right, and sort of that's what you see happening. It's largely happening as we expect it across the different businesses. And again, you saw you got the full impact of a rate rise in December in those numbers and you got a little piece of one in March as well. And so I think you can kind of read into the numbers and see what you think sort of the average beta is there, and you're probably not that far off.",neutral,0.1386,0.0307,0.8307
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. The second part of the question, I guess, implied with your lead-in that could continue to see some width from that imputed beta as well?",neutral,0.1851,0.0171,0.7977

2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. As rates rise, we would expect betas to continue to increase.",positive,0.9393,0.0156,0.0451
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Excellent. Okay. And then for my follow-up here. It looks like some really nice trends in consulting expenses. It's my recollection, but I'm not 100% sure here, that maybe some CCAR and regulatory expenses were flowing through that line. Are we finally reaching the point where we're getting some relief on the regulatory expense front? Does that mean that -- that would mean and imply to me at least that, that's sustainable or should be given where everything that you guys have built up from a capabilities perspective plus the environment that we're in, is that true and you think that, that's a fair conclusion to come to?",neutral,0.405,0.0231,0.5719
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Let me take a stab, Mike, and you tell me whether you agree. How's that? I think the answer is predominantly, yes, but I'd just make a couple of comments on that. I think the very significant amounts that we spent on consulting for those specific things you talked about, for the most part, what will not continue at the levels that you've seen and you see the benefits of that running through our results. I will say, and I have got the thing like the newcomer -- relative newcomer, and I'm sure, you'll appreciate this. There's a hugely significant amount of regulatory expense and bettered in the other lines that's just the reality of what the regulatory environment is today versus what it was years ago. So we spent a tremendous amount on regulatory. It's just not specifically in the consulting line and that's not going to go down for what we see at this point in time. And we continue to spend a significant amount of money outside the U.S., specifically for GDPR and MiFID II inside Europe. So just think about it as it's a little bit of a reallocation from consulting to us doing a bunch of the work, whether it's the headcount expense, technology expense and things like that.",neutral,0.1156,0.0213,0.8631
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, and I'll just add one thing. So as we've said a number of times to you, the decline you see in consulting, we had -- this time last year, we were still working on sort of the resolution plan, and so a big chunk of that decline was related to that activity that we're working on last year. But Charlie is right. There's a -- there may be a little bit of a pause in the short run, but -- in the U.S., but there's plenty of effort that is going into a number of initiatives across the globe.",negative,0.0423,0.8712,0.0865

13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"One question on Investment Management. I don't know if you had the gain on the sale that entity and then also on the performance fees, stronger-than-expected, you guys mentioned, some of the drivers. I just want to get a sense, has anything changed in terms of the recognition by quarter that we should expect things to be different than what we've seen historically?",neutral,0.2355,0.0464,0.7181

It's not a material game changer or mover for the overall results, but it is in the number.",neutral,0.0511,0.0615,0.8873
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Okay. And then follow-up on the Investment Services business. If I just look at the, I guess, quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year, just the revenue growth versus the asset growth, that came in stronger and typically we are not seeing that, but it seems like under the new disclosure, that can be either activity with volatility or rate with net interest income, so just wanted to get a sense. And then in terms of predicting that line, you guys give a lot of metrics. I know you're not giving that -- the win metrics, but is there anything else that we should be thinking about to try to think about either forecasting that line item going forward?",neutral,0.0679,0.0285,0.9037
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, I think in the Asset Servicing business, when you look at it in the earnings release, just keep in mind, what's also in there is net interest revenue. And so net interest revenue was, as we mentioned, a significant driver of sort of the overall business results. And I think that's true in Asset Servicing as well. You also have the impact of the market and FX and so forth. So just keep that in mind as you sort of look at that overall number. In terms of metrics to look at in terms of forecasting, I don't think there is anything necessarily new to sort of add to that conversation.",neutral,0.063,0.0288,0.9083
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"The only thing I would add is, again, it was a very good quarter relative to asset values, the impacts in volatility on us and rates. And so we were clearly beneficiaries of that. That was a -- it was an important driver as we've said in our comments of the results. We also had significant balance growth that we saw. So as we look forward to next quarter, it's -- sitting here today, it's not as strong as it was, but on a year-over-year basis, still should look -- I would say we still feel good about what we're going to see.",positive,0.802,0.0226,0.1754

9,Geoffrey Elliott,,"Sure, sure, understood. And I guess, thinking about the full year, is there anything that kind of gives you more confidence that you can do better on the expense side given what you've seen in the first quarter?",neutral,0.4644,0.0265,0.5091
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. I don't -- we're not going to give you a number for the full year, but as we've said in a bunch of different ways, we're coming in everyday focused on making sure that we're doing the best we can to keep the expense base where it needs to be, while making the investments we need to make.",neutral,0.1792,0.015,0.8058
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.,neutral,0.0348,0.0301,0.9351
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Just had a quick question. One on your comments around the deposits. Thought it was a little early in the quarter to be calling out the runoff that you're seeing. Can you just identify whether that was going to be interest bearing, noninterest bearing or I mean, was it a significant magnitude of deposit outflow that you saw?",neutral,0.0472,0.0831,0.8696
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Well, I think what -- we were kind of calling out as what we mentioned in March as well at Investor Day is that we saw higher balances in Jan and Feb, January and February, than we thought we would see. So now balances are sort of back down to about where we thought they would be. And there's no single driver of that sort of -- it sort of normalized to where we expected, so.",neutral,0.1835,0.3905,0.426
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,[indiscernible] interest bearing – go ahead.,neutral,0.0406,0.0302,0.9293
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"I'm sorry, yes, yes, you saw both noninterest bearing and interest bearing come down.",negative,0.0319,0.8634,0.1047
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Okay. And then, you did have some securities sales in the quarter. Was that just slightly repositioning the book? Or is there something like you're seeing with rising rates, you're looking to get more shorter duration overall?",neutral,0.0945,0.0727,0.8328
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"It was a very minor repositioning that we're able to do due to the adoption of a new accounting standard that allowed us to reclassify some of our HDM bonds, so very minor in scheme of the portfolio.",neutral,0.332,0.0258,0.6422
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,It is just one time in?,neutral,0.0295,0.088,0.8825

0,Operator,,Our final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital.,neutral,0.032,0.0268,0.9413
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"You guys have talked about at Investor Day and today about the emphasis on technology, investing and spending. When you look at it from a line of business standpoint, is there 1 or 2 lines that have a greater focus of this spending?",neutral,0.0522,0.0235,0.9243
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"So you mean, which business?",neutral,0.0356,0.05,0.9144
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,Which? Between Asset Servicing and Investment Management.,neutral,0.0319,0.0464,0.9217
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,Correct. Exactly. Is there an area that you guys think that you need to put more effort and money versus another area within the organization?,neutral,0.0729,0.0261,0.901
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"It's probably skewed somewhat towards Investment Services versus Investment Management, but that's not to say that there aren't a significant amount of opportunities for us that we're focused on to use technology in the Investment Management business, whether it's Wealth Management or in the Asset Management side. When it comes to the core, we talked about the investments that we're making in infrastructure, I would say the majority of those comments relate to the Investment Services business and the work that we're doing there.",neutral,0.0588,0.0263,0.9149
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, I know there is a lot of moving parts with the capital, notice of proposed rulemaking that have come out recently from the Fed. Hopefully, it will settle down. But when you guys look longer term, there was -- it looks like a lift in the dividend payout ratio. There used to be a soft line at 30%. When you guys look out longer term, do you have a sense of where you think the dividend payout ratio will go relative to stock buybacks and stuff that you use for return of capital?",neutral,0.2227,0.0508,0.7265
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"No, I think sitting here today, I don't think anything is different than -- I don't think we're thinking about it any differently than what we've said at Investor Day relative to the dividend. 
All righty, well, thank you all very much for the time. Take care.",neutral,0.1313,0.0229,0.8457
