And our first question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.",neutral,0.0473,0.0213,0.9313
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Eric, I'd like to sort of double click on some of the comments that you made about deposits. So you talked about back book pricing in the U.S. dollar book. Does that mean that we should be thinking about the potential for betas to exceed 100% here when that starts to work through? And what kind of magnitude do you think that could reach? And could you also help me understand the euro? Because when I look in the financial supplement and the breakout by currency, it looks like the euro deposit costs were up about low 40s bps quarter-over-quarter, which seems like a beta that's a good deal higher than the 50% you referenced. I know there's some swap noise. So maybe that's what it is. But could you maybe flesh that out a bit for me?",neutral,0.2462,0.0292,0.7246
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brennan, sure. Let me start on the betas that we saw in particular in the U.S. book because we are at a period in the interest rate cycle where we've now had multiple 50 basis points moved. It's been a very strong signal to our clients that rates are much, much higher, much more quickly and much more visibly. And at the same time, they now have -- because of the highly inverted yield curve, they have real substitute alternatives that they used to not have in the past, whether it's treasuries, whether it's money market, whether it's repo, there's a range of what they can invest in. 
And what we found is that our larger clients, and we primarily have large, sophisticated clients, are quite active in thinking about their alternatives and that, that has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed. 
If we think about the U.S. deposit betas, they were in the 80% to 90% range the last couple of quarters. This quarter, we saw 100%. And yes, we expect next quarter we'll be well over 100%. And what's driving that is really a catch-up in the back book. We have clients coming to us as you'd expect, just like it happens with retail -- depositors for retail banks, but we have sophisticated large clients coming back and saying, look, some of our lower transactional rate levels or mid-tier rate levels are something that they'd like us to adjust. 
And in a way, what I think has played out is that while spreads widened for us on the deposit, but for some period of time, we're now seeing a convergence back to where they would have been. And that's coming through. And so what we have in the cycle is actually a number of quarters of below 100% betas, then we get to 100% beta. And then we are going to have a quarter where betas are well above that 100% level. And it's really a catch-up in the back book, and that's what's playing through. 
It is -- what is beginning to drive this higher reduction in NII this quarter, the 10% quarter-on-quarter that you saw, you saw in my outlook, we are expecting 12% to 18% production in NII this coming quarter. And if you peel that apart, some of that is the continued rotation out of noninterest-bearing, but some of it and a good part of it is this catch-up in the back book that's playing through. 
We do think that over time, we've seen the bulk of that and that, that will begin to moderate, and I'm certainly happy to go into that. And some of our perspectives as we drill down deeply into our areas. But that's the context. 
On your other question on euros, we should probably follow up. I think we see betas quarter-on-quarter of about 50%, but we should probably just follow up offline, because I think that's deep in the supplement and probably do that with you and the IR team.",neutral,0.1209,0.0426,0.8365
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. No problem. And then another question, just quickly on fee revenue. You flagged that the large client migration is going to be part of the outlook. Is the -- how much of that will be impacting the third quarter delta? And then how much will be -- how should we be thinking about the time frame for whatever is left and when that would end up playing out?",neutral,0.0341,0.1617,0.8043
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I think the broader context, as you recall, Brennan, is that we disclosed that the large client deconversion was going to happen over multiple years. We announced it well over a year ago. And we described it in our K at about 1.7% of fee revenue. So you can calculate that through. 
I think in our fourth quarter earnings call in January, I described that we had seen about $20 million on a run rate come out, but I'll -- I can reconfirm that. This -- in the next quarter -- this coming third quarter, we'll see about $20 million come out sequentially. And then in the fourth quarter, there's another piece of about another $15 million that will come out as well. And then after that, it's several more quarters before we see the later and final installments. But that's incorporated into our guide.",neutral,0.044,0.0363,0.9197
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0341,0.0436,0.9223
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So just maybe staying on the deposit question for another minute. Why do you guys think this catch-up happening now sort of late in the cycle? We've obviously been in a higher rate environment for well over a year. So curious if you can provide more color on particular customer segments in the U.S. that's driving that and sort of the discussions around that? 
And then maybe as you sort of think about the end state for U.S. interest-bearing deposits, I think you're at 3.5 or so today. The cumulative beta on that is, I think, is around 70% relative to the Fed funds rate. Should we think of that approaching, I don't know, 85%, 90% kind of, how do you think about where that deposit price in the U.S. will stabilize?",neutral,0.0542,0.0399,0.906
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Alex, it's a good question. I mean, we're clearly navigating and living through an interest rate environment that we've not seen in 2 decades, right? You've got to go back pre-crisis before you see 5% prevailing rates. I think if you also think about how swiftly we've gotten to where we are, that's why we created -- we put some of this information back on Page 16 in our materials. You see this cycle has moved twice as far in terms of the uptick in rates in half the time of the last cycle. And so what plays out as that happens is that we always have clients that, as rates move up, they begin discussing with us and engaging with us on what would be appropriate, maybe putting in place multiple balance tiers, having discussions about their expectations, we negotiate and so forth. And you can imagine large client discussions occur over 3, 6, sometimes even 9-month periods. 
And so if you kind of turn back the clock and say, when did some of those discussions occur, some of the early ones may have started second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, fourth quarter of last year because there was also a perspective among our clients, and us for that matter, that rates might continue to 5%, but they might have gone to 4% or 3%, which would have put us and our clients in a different position from a NIM and NII and rate-setting perspective. 
So I think it's really the speed of this that has played out and -- on one hand. And on the other, the inverted yield curve gives clients and the prevalence of the money funds and Treasuries and so forth, give clients an alternative, right, that's more vivid, I'd say, than in some of the past cycles. And so that's the kind of client behavior. 
What we have seen is that if you decompose our book, some of this activity is in the noninterest-bearing deposits, which have come down. And some of it is in the interest-bearing back book because some clients with noninterest-bearing deposits come to us and say, ""Look, can you make them now interest-bearing at a certain rate?"" And what we've seen is some real segmentation of that book. As an example, the average account in noninterest-bearing, there's about 30,000 accounts. The average account is barely over $1 million. 
What you can do, and some of the analytic work we've done, is separate out the higher balance noninterest-bearing clients and client accounts from the lower balance ones. Not surprisingly, the higher balance accounts are down year-over-year in balance terms by 70%, right? The large number of smaller accounts are down by 15%. And so this is where what we're starting to work through with the, what I'll describe as the burn down. How much of the larger deposits and noninterest-bearing have migrated to interest-bearing, right, at what rate. And our perspective is that we are now working through, I'll describe as a catch-up on the back book. Some of that is noninterest-bearing deposits moving to interest-bearing and some of that is interest-bearing being priced up. 
And as we think about it, we think that the peak of that catch-up will play out in third quarter as we scan the deposit types, the larger, more sophisticated clients versus the smaller clients. And that's why we expect both the catch-up to continue into the third quarter and likely peak in the third quarter, and then begin to moderate in the fourth quarter and to burn down.",neutral,0.0527,0.0568,0.8905
4,Alexander Blostein,,Got it. And then like just the end game in terms of what you ultimately think U.S. deposit cost is going to look like relative to kind of the 3.5 and the Fed funds at 5?,neutral,0.0613,0.0496,0.8892
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"I think it's -- I've not calculated it directly on a cost versus rate basis, on a NIM basis, but I guess we could back into it if it'd be helpful to you. As we think about the long range view of NII on our book, I've given some guidance for 3Q NII, for 4Q NII. I think our instinct is that NII will settle in this $550 million to $600 million range per quarter. And if it's helpful, we can try to calculate that back into a spread on assets or a spread or a cost of funds on deposits and follow up with you.",neutral,0.0644,0.0215,0.9141
4,Alexander Blostein,,"I got you. That's helpful. And my bigger picture question for you guys and to Ron as well is, I think you mentioned productivity efforts in light of the fact that NII has clearly become a bigger headwind over the next several quarters and you guided servicing fees down in the third quarter. 
So as you think about measuring those productivities, are you solving for overall pretax margin stability? Are you solving for kind of fee margin stability, sort of like ex NII? How should we think about sort of measuring the productivity efforts in light of a more challenging revenue backdrop?",negative,0.038,0.7866,0.1754
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. Alex, I mean, where we start with is -- I mean, because what you're describing is outcomes of the productivity efforts where we've -- and these are not new, these are ongoing. We really start with, how do we create more scale in our business? How do we increase speed, lower error rates, increase client satisfaction, take out manual interventions. 
So the measures that we're using would be the traditional productivity measures, and this has been underway now for several years. You've been seeing the results in our -- and we've been able to manage costs certainly relative to others. 
But in terms of how we think about the business going forward, particularly given that NII is no longer a tailwind in terms of an outcome basis, we really think about the operating leverage, I think, is the key outcome we're managing to, if that's the question you're asking.",neutral,0.2108,0.0129,0.7763
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research.,neutral,0.0339,0.0553,0.9108
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"Just trying to ask about the asset side and the securities book quickly. Decent uplift in yield again, plus 21 basis points. Can you give some color, some numbers around the front book, back book difference there? And how much repricing can sort of assist NII going forward?",neutral,0.1302,0.015,0.8548
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Rob, it's Eric. There is a good bit of tailwind that comes from the front book, back book. I think this, on a kind of year-on-year basis, long rates were quite constructive from a year-on-year NII standpoint, the long rate tailwind year-on-year was in the $100 million basis. So it's quite substantial. 
On a quarter-on-quarter, the long rate tailwind is closer to $15 million, $20 million. So it's not insubstantial. And I think as we see some steepness in the curve come back, or I guess I'll describe less inversion, we've got some -- we've got abilities to leg into duration or curve positions or, in some cases, some amount of convexity where we'd find it helpful. 
From a rate standpoint, like you said, average rates on the investment portfolio in aggregate was 270 basis points or so. The runoff is a good bit below that, kind of in the 180 basis point range, so 90 basis points, 100 basis points south of that. And the roll-on that occurs is well above that 270 basis point average, is closer to 410 basis points or more. So you've got a nice tailwind there that's playing through. 
We also have a tailwind on short rates for international currencies. So that's helpful. And then we are -- we continue to invest and think about opportunities across currency from a basis standpoint and so forth, and we've got some latitude to do that as well, given our global balance sheet.",neutral,0.181,0.0345,0.7845
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"And then one more just on the operational deposits. If I use the numbers on Page 10, operational -- or excuse me, overall deposits are down and operational deposits are down as a percentage of the mix. Conceptually, what would be driving that? I guess I'm confused as to why operational deposits would be down year-over-year more than non-operational deposits.",negative,0.0083,0.9469,0.0448
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I think there's a little bit of -- I look at that data, and I think you've got roughly similar movements in operational and non-operational deposits. I think what's happening in this part of the cycle is as deposits or I'll say, as cash for our clients is more valuable, right, they are selectively thinking about how much cash do I absolutely must keep in the -- in their custodial accounts. And if you think about it, they make that decision in, I think it's more than 100,000 different accounts themselves, right? It's a very large and disparate set of decisions and sub decisions by 100,000-plus fund managers and many, many fund boards. 
And so they're trying to see, hey, can I edge it down, and that's why at this point in the cycle, you see total deposits drift down, but also operational. 
What they end up needing to trade off, and the reason why it will level off over time, is that they need a certain amount of deposits so they don't overdraw. They -- fund managers really hate the overdraw at the end of day. And then there's also a governor where we engage with our clients on intraday, and make sure that they have enough cash to cover their transactional flow and throughput, but we're just at the period where in the core custody accounts, you've got there's this drift downwards where they're trying to optimize without going too far, and that's what you're seeing. 
But this is expected. We expect the operational deposits to stay comfortably in this kind of 75% range. And it's a part of the kind of custodial operations, which is what makes them so sticky, right, because they need to be there for the very significant daily, hourly and minute-by-minute transactional flows that we are processing on their behalf so that they aren't overdrawn.",neutral,0.0505,0.2554,0.6942
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore.,neutral,0.0371,0.0542,0.9087
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Maybe just a different attempt at the deposit discussion. So I get clients wanting more yield. I bought Treasuries too, we all did. But is there any point where the client profitability discussion has teeth? Like are they able to move 100% of nonoperating deposits if they want? Like what discussions are you having with them about doing more with State Street in areas like FX, sec lending, Alpha. But maybe you could update us on what you're doing to try to help impact what -- seems like you can't impact the deposit side. So is there anything else you can do?",neutral,0.0948,0.0176,0.8875
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. Let me start there, Glenn, and I think Ron will weigh in as well, because a number of us have these engaging conversations with clients. I think from a burn down standpoint, let me first take it from that angle, is if you think about our $200 billion of deposits, we've got deposits at a number of different price tiers and we have kind of very large sophisticated clients and then kind of that large tail of small and midsized clients. Of the $200 billion, we think there's about $50 billion that we've been very focused on and continue to be focused on. 
So about 1/4 of our total deposits are with these clients that as we've talked about the last couple of questions, there's been real catch-up on the back book. I described that because of that $50 billion, which is either a very low price or 0 price for our larger and most sophisticated clients, where we have these engaging and balance of trade discussions, right? We've around -- we've got about $25 billion that's behind us, where largely we've repriced those deposits. We've had those discussions and some of those have come with some balance of trade improvements or some commitments on stability on fees, and those are behind us. 
Included in the outlook that I provide, beyond the $25 billion, there's another $15 billion that's underway right now that's included in my third quarter outlook, right? So that gets us to $35 billion, almost $40 billion of the $50 billion. And then there's a trail that we'll still have. And so, I think from a client discussion and negotiation standpoint, the third quarter we expect to be the peak. 
I think what you'll find is that each of these questions on deposits, certainly rates goes through a pricing committee from a balance sheet management standpoint. But very quickly, those go to the most senior client executives and all the way up to our C-suite, because those are large. They're very large, and that's where we engage. 
And I think what you'll see over time is some of that will come back through in FX revenues and sec lending revenues and the absence of fee rate reductions in the future, right, on one hand. And on the other hand, some of what we do here is also work with clients on expanding the range of what we do for them when it comes to managing their cash, right? 
I think some of the reason you're seeing the uptick in cash with -- in our asset management business is because some of those clients say, look, I'd like to be in a cash money market sweep, and so we've been doing that. You see our repo business continues to do very, very well, is actually an add to -- it's a stabilizer to NII or an add to NII on a year-on-year basis and stabilizing, and it's a stable source of NII income quarter-on-quarter because we've been able to shift some of the client cash to those areas. So there are some offsets as well there. But that's a bit of a start.",neutral,0.109,0.0272,0.8638
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes, Glenn, what I would add to what Eric said is that the -- if you think about over the last 4, 5 years, our focus on pricing has been -- initially was on fee pricing and kind of addressing, if not combating, the fee compression and really working that in an institutional way and at a very high skilled way and escalating those -- or elevating those decisions way above where they used to be. 
Deposits for -- up until this rate cycle really weren't part of that because, I mean, there were times that we would just as soon not have had the deposits. We've now integrated that, as Eric has implied, into that discussion, but also included a full share of wallet analysis. And part of this is recognizing that these institutions are very large. And when you have a pricing discussion, and I'm putting that in air quotes, it really depends on what it is. 
And what we have worked to avoid is to not have a series of unilateral discussions without understanding and making sure that at the highest levels of our clients, they understand the impact of this. And just reminding them that you have the fee you have because of this assumption on other services that we're going to provide you or some assumption on deposits. 
And those conversations are actually starting to work well. It's caused a change of process for us, another change of process for us. But more importantly, it's changed in the way how we're engaging and at what level we're engaging with these clients. And so more to go there, but we also think it's a skill that, now developed, will help us through various kinds of cycles going forward.",neutral,0.0929,0.037,0.8701
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.,neutral,0.0348,0.045,0.9202
44,Hang Leung,,"This is actually Sharon Leung filling in for Steven. Just on the deposits, outside of the rotation out of NIB, can you talk about the overall trajectory of total deposits, particularly because it looks like more recent liquidity drawdown has come out of RRP instead of deposits. 
So, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the expectations for the trajectory on deposits from here in the context of QT, treasury issuance, et cetera?",neutral,0.037,0.0539,0.9091
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, it's Eric. It's hard to really gauge the deposit changes outright. I think we're a little more focused on the net interest -- I'm sorry, the noninterest-bearing deposits where we've signaled another $5 billion in likely outflow this coming quarter. That's less of an outflow than in the second quarter. So you're starting to see some of the burn down that I've described. 
In the external environment, I think from the H.8 reports as banks, we've seen about a 2% sequential fall in deposits. For the trust banks, we tend to have more deposits coming in when deposits in the bank system increase, and we have somewhat more coming out when deposits of the bank system come out and partly just the absolute sophistication of our clients. 
So we're -- we expect a downtick in deposits again next quarter but have just been a little more focused on the noninterest-bearing because that's where it makes a big difference. I think there is always some movement in interest-bearing deposits, especially at the higher rate tier because what we're finding increasingly as we get to a little more of this -- as we expect to get to a time stabilization or at least a little more of a balance with our clients. 
Now what they're going to do is, it's hard for them to move an underlying operating deposit that actually has to cover the hundreds, thousands, in some cases, tens of thousands of transactions that are flowing through their particular account but sometimes they'll move the thin margin deposits to a Treasury. And so we might lose 10 basis points on something and they'll pick up 10 basis points on Treasury. 
So there's some of that that's going on. And I think in truth, that's not as dominant a driver of our NII at this point.",negative,0.0354,0.8336,0.1309
44,Hang Leung,,"And then as a follow-up, just on some of the updated capital rules that are coming. I understand you probably won't be able to give much color because we haven't seen a proposal yet. But just in terms of like expected ways you might be able to mitigate some of that impact and which businesses might be more impacted for you guys?",neutral,0.1006,0.0221,0.8773
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I mean there's -- obviously, we're like many waiting to see more from the rules. We've -- the last time we saw Basel III Endgame, draft from either the U.S. or international regulators was several years back. So I think we've -- we expect some higher capital requirements, just hard to tell how much. 
We do think there'll be effects on different parts of our businesses. So the new rules will come with an operational deposit -- operational capital charge. That probably will be relatively hard to influence because we actually want to build our fee-driven businesses. And so those, I think, will just come with a capital requirement that's -- that will be an add. 
There'll be some reduction on the lending book, so that will be helpful. And then I think in particular, while the fundamental review of the trading book will affect the universal banks, potentially in a negative way, for us, the sec finance business will tend to be a positive, will be in a positive territory where capital requirements will be less. We'll no longer need to hold capital to indemnify Treasuries. So they'll finally become economically more rational in the safer areas, right, as they should be. They should obviously -- capital needs to be held for the -- for the riskier activities. But we don't traffic in the riskier areas. 
And I think that, in some ways, that will give us an opportunity to grow those areas that are quite aligned with our client base like sec finance, and actually deploy capital more actively. And so I think there'll be a mix of impacts, we're going to see as it comes through, but I -- like many we're -- we're considering what's to come, and we'll react accordingly as it does.",neutral,0.2142,0.0157,0.7701
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0344,0.0435,0.9221
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Ron, I guess I wanted to come back to your comments on the -- basically, the overall revenue per client, if I can sort of summarize it that way. Obviously, there are different components of how clients, the asset servicing clients pay for the business, and there are many different ways aside from the core fees that they can do that. So as you think about that across the client base, I know you have looked at this more holistically across clients over many, many years. 
But with the deposit beta going up, is that sort of revenue per client going down? Or do you think you're able to actually be able to improve the fee rate given that they aren't paying as much on the compensating balances?",neutral,0.2583,0.0783,0.6634
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Brian, it's a good question. And what I was referring to and what you're referring to is what I would call how we think about this tactically client by client, but I also want to come back to the strategic elements of this also. 
In terms of -- there's no one answer for any particular client because if you think about it, in the core back office business, you've got custody fund accounting and there's a pricing element to that along, typically, with associated deposits. In more and more instances, obviously, we've -- a client might have a middle office assignment with us where we're doing -- we are their back office and obviously, going all the way to Alpha. And then there's the question of, are we doing FX and securities finance with them? Obviously, FX is a function of, are they -- do they have occasion to use FX? And increasingly, most managers do, securities finance it's manager by manager. 
So the reason why I'm saying it's tactical, it's -- there's a holistic conversation that needs to occur here. And it's important on both sides, ours included, to lay out for the client that remember all we did for you over the past few years to get you through whatever fee challenges they were having. That was predicated on X. And X might be an assumed deposit level, it might be on an assumed FX level, X isn't playing out. We need to have a conversation on this. And that could, in cases, lead to more fees or it could -- and the more typical outcome is that, well, hey, we're not doing this with you, let's try and do that. Or even, there's this set of funds over here that we've never talked about, whatever, the Cayman Islands or something, and let's see if we can move those. 
I mean this deposit situation is a challenge, the conversations it's spurring are opportunities. And they're real opportunities. There's senior people intimately involved in these because we don't get a lot of redos on them. This is the moment to be doing it. So we think it's a way to -- I mean, again, the kind of NII outflow is a significant headwind, but we think it's an opportunity to mitigate some of it. 
The strategic side of this, Brian, I don't want to lose, right? Because going back to the acquisition of Charles River, the launch of Alpha, all the development we've been doing, we're now seeing onboarding happening there. With the typical onboarding journey tends to be the lower fee complicated kind of middle office stuff starts first. And then there's follow-on services. And it's making sure that we are implementing, addressing and implementing those follow-on services as fast as possible. So when we talked earlier and talked about the onboarding, I talked about that we were able to move a little over $1 trillion in to be onboarded, to onboarded. 
What will follow there is other services and increase kind of the revenue per asset per -- I mean that's the way Alpha works and that's the way Alpha is going to play out, which is why notwithstanding the short-term issues that Eric has raised in terms of we've got this client transition. We're actually quite optimistic over the -- what I would call the short to medium term, as we look into 2024, about the revenue picture.",neutral,0.0506,0.0311,0.9183
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"That's great color. And then maybe just on the expense side, Eric had mentioned the expense levers. Are they more tactical in nature? Or do you see sort of an ability to reengineer -- continue to reengineer the cost base. You've already done a great job in reducing costs structurally over the last several years. I don't know if we're like mostly through that and when you do have the cost saves you reinvest them in growth initiatives? Or is there an ability to sort of reduce the overall cost structure?",neutral,0.1443,0.0199,0.8357
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Brian, let me address that first, and then Eric will come in. The -- we are definitely not through this. And by that I mean, when we started down this journey a couple of years ago, we obviously addressed, call it what you want, the lower-hanging fruit, the kinds of things that we could get out without a lot of technology investment, without a lot of reengineering. But there is more to do, and we're making a lot of progress on it. 
We've got people in place now on both the operations reengineering side and on the technology side that are working this through. The way this has played through in our results, you've seen what our expenses have been, but we've also been able to invest more in the businesses than we otherwise would. And we think that, that journey has more to go, and you'll see that and we'll report on that quarter after quarter. 
What we also talked about, though, is that there's some tactical things that we can do and should do, just given the kind of outlook that we've described to you. And those would be less about reengineering and more about how do we think about short-term things like incentives and those things.",neutral,0.1109,0.0173,0.8717
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"And just to round that out, we've got to pay for performance. So when we have larger -- we deliver larger sales, we'll pay for that. When it's a little lighter, as you saw, we'll rein that in, and that's part of the execution mindset we have. 
We've also just given some of the evolution on salary increases and -- that we've all worked through the last couple of quarters of the last year. We also feel like it's time where we have enough staff, and so we've put in place a hiring freeze because we need to contain our staffing costs. And we need to make sure as we reengineer, we actually redeploy our folks to, say, new business areas or to growth areas and actually pare down others. 
And the way to do that in a more emphatic way tactically, right, is to be particularly disciplined on hiring and freeze that or just limit it. And so given the short-term performance, we're doing that as well, which gives you a sense for our willingness to bend the cost curve.",neutral,0.1664,0.2183,0.6153
