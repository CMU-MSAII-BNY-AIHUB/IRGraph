0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0461,0.0236,0.9303
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So first, Eric, for you, maybe just to clarify some of the comments you made around servicing fees. So you talked about $1.5 trillion in sort of annual client attrition. Is that a -- that's about 4%, I think, of your AUC. Is that sort of what we should be thinking about as kind of like a gross impact on revenues as well? And qualitatively, how does that compare to prior periods? Has anything changed that sort of drives this churn higher?",neutral,0.1004,0.0892,0.8105
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Alex, it's Eric. Thanks for the question. We're trying to be real clear about our sales expectations for our business because at the end of the day, that is part of what we do every day, and we do it across segments, across regions, across client groups. And I think to kind of give you some perspective on that, we wanted to be clear that to actually have to demonstrate net new business, right, so to be able to offset the nominal amount of attrition that we always get, which is a few percentage points, and actually overcome that plus deliver some amount of net new business growth, we need about $1.5 trillion of gross new sales a year to accomplish that. And we think that's what would really contribute to the rebound of growth that we'd like to see. 
Now in truth, we've not gotten there this year. This year, net new business was flat, and you saw our AUC/A wins at about $800 billion. And so it's just obviously an area of pretty intense focus. But I think it's the kind of area that we feel like we can make a dent on. If you step back, we've made really good progress on our top 50 clients where we rolled out a coverage process and set of executives about 2 years ago, and we've seen the growth there. We've seen it in a couple of segments. And now we need to broaden that and deepen that kind of coverage intensity across the rest of the franchise.",positive,0.5211,0.0179,0.4609
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. Alex, I'd like to just add to that. I would not want to leave you with the impression that there's a client retention problem here. If anything, client retention has gone up. But if you think about things like what the market is facing in terms of reduction in funds, for example, or if you think about M&A, oftentimes, that presents an opportunity for us. So there's a small amount of attrition broadly defined. It's as much asset attrition as it is client attrition. And what we're trying to be here is very clear on how we think about our -- what we need to do from a sales perspective and what we're doing about it.",neutral,0.0642,0.1638,0.772
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Great. That clears it up a bit. Speaking of M&A, Ron, I wanted to ask you a question around SSGA. Obviously, there's been several headlines around potential strategic actions State Street could make around its asset management business. And in the past, you also talked about the drive for scale in that business just like what you're trying to provide to your clients. So maybe you can update us on your latest kind of strategic thinking for SSGA when it comes to either acquisitions or divestitures? Obviously, there is a JV headline out there as well. And as you think about sort of these various avenues, what is the ultimate kind of financial and strategic goal you're trying to achieve for State Street as a whole when it comes to SSGA?",neutral,0.0794,0.0157,0.9049
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. Alex, I'm not going to comment on market rumors. But what I'm going to say is what I've said before. We have a very strong franchise in SSGA. It's particularly strong in the ETF space, the cash base, the indexing space. It's got an increasingly strong position in ESG. Having said that, as we've said before, we see the world evolving. And therefore, we need to think about how to add capabilities, both product and distribution capabilities or distribution access to this. So we are -- it's not new. Any time you ask us about this, I think I answer it more or less the same way that we're constantly thinking about this. 
We've made some steps over the past several years in terms of organically adding really important product capability, fixed -- for example, fixed income ETF, ESG capabilities. We launched the low-cost range of funds. We created the distribution arrangement to help propel those low-cost funds. So we will continue to look at those things, and we'll continue to look at inorganic activities if we think it's the best outcome. And to answer the last part of your question, what we're looking to do is to best position SSGA for growth. It's a remarkable asset. It's got a lot of potential, and we'll do what we need to do to best position it for growth.",neutral,0.2679,0.0109,0.7213
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,neutral,0.0376,0.033,0.9294
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Eric, just a follow-on on the NII side. I just wondering if you could help us understand, you talked about some type of step off from fourth to first in terms of NII and then stabilization. And I'm just wondering if you can walk us through the pieces of what are still moving through other than day count in the first quarter. And how much premium AUM was in the quarter? And is that part of a rate of change that you can see any type of -- help that stabilization or benefit thereafter?",neutral,0.0559,0.0321,0.9119
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Ken, it's Eric. Sure. Let me describe first maybe third quarter to fourth quarter, to give you some context and then fourth quarter to first quarter and then kind of the -- what we see from there. Going into the fourth quarter, we have the usual headwinds from investment -- from the investment portfolio and actually higher premium amortization than we've had previously. And that would cost us sequentially about $35 million. That's kind of the headwind. Now that will come back because that headwind is attenuating each quarter, but that was a headwind. 
Against that headwind in the fourth quarter, we had some unusual benefits. We had the FX swap mark-to-market, which was about $5. We had a surge in deposits, both in developed markets and in emerging markets. Remember, they're valuable in emerging markets worth about $10 as a tailwind. And then we built our investment portfolio and added quite a bit of loans at -- to the tune of about $20 million. And that was a larger build than usual, but a remunerative one. And so those are the kind of features that held us flat in effect from 3Q to 4Q. 
I think if we go into first quarter, you kind of take each of those in pieces. The investment portfolio headwind, it's probably going to be about $25 million instead of $35 million. So you see it attenuate. And part of that is that the prepayment speeds are neutral, we think, from 4Q to 1Q. We have some tailwinds of deposits and loans and investments, but that's probably worth about $10. And then we still have a couple of headwinds. We have the unwind of the swap mark-to-market which sequentially is worth $10 because you got to double up the positive turns negative. And then you have day count worth another $10 as a headwind. So that's kind of what gets us to the guide that we gave. 
Once we get through the first quarter, I think what we expect to see is that stabilization. And what we're effectively expecting is that the investment portfolio headwind, which was $35 million, becoming $25 million, is going to start to trend down to $10 million a quarter. And why is that? Partly rates have been kind of working through the -- on the yield side and partly because prepayment speeds, we expect to start to attenuate as we see higher rates. And so we do expect some lesser headwinds. And against that, we think that the actions that we take on a more traditional basis will be worth about plus $10 million. And so we'll be roughly neutral and stable from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q and so forth. Obviously, it will be range bound. And obviously, it will be -- there's always a little bit of lumpiness that we get into. But that's our best estimate of what we're seeing today based on the curves, the expectations of rates and so forth.",neutral,0.0783,0.2036,0.718
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"So Eric, sorry, if I can speak that back at you. Does that mean kind of a $50-something million decline fourth to first, if I got all your add ups there, $10 million -- $25 million and 3 -- and $10 million and $10 million and $10 million? Just trying to understand what that all gets to.",neutral,0.0767,0.1445,0.7788
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes. I think I said 6% to 8%. So I think we're looking at, whatever, $35 million decline in the first quarter and then stable from there.",negative,0.0502,0.9259,0.0239
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. Sorry, got it. Understood. All right, great. And then just one follow-up on a big picture, unfortunately, another news item to ask you about we're going on. Now, I guess, 9 months since the BlackRock ETF headline news was out there as well. And I know it's a specific client. But there's a way of just helping us understand just what needs to happen for that to either be codified as you're keeping it or going away? Just any commentary would be helpful.",neutral,0.0576,0.0219,0.9205
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. That process is still underway. We're working very closely with them. They have not made any decisions at this, but we are feeling reasonably positive about them.",neutral,0.4695,0.0198,0.5108
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"And Ken, it's Eric. I'll also just remind you, though, that is a growing -- it's a growing business, a growing asset at quite a high pace, right? And so I think the last time we had one of these, it took 3 years from start to finish to kind of work out from discussion to RFP to response and so forth. And so I think there's -- you just have to factor that into the -- any scenarios that you run.",neutral,0.0837,0.0154,0.901
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0352,0.0614,0.9034
15,Adam Quincy Beatty,,"This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just wanted to focus in a little bit on some of the softness you mentioned in the U.S. and EMEA mid-market space. And wondering if you could help us maybe size that a little bit, recognizing your efforts to broaden and diversify the business, just in terms of the core of what you've got right now, either maybe size it or talk about the impact that had on your '21 guide. And also interested in any interaction with the activities of the pricing committee there in terms of either structuring, pricing or what have you in order to better retain or win business.",neutral,0.1761,0.0092,0.8148
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Sure, Adam. It's Eric. Let me start. I think the way we think about our business on the servicing side is across segments, right? We have asset managers, we have asset owners, we have insurers, and our business is more geared to asset managers than the other segments. And so we've historically built our franchise there, but we've actually had quite a bit of success in other -- in those other segments as well. 
Within asset managers, what we're starting to find is over the last year -- last 2 years, the last year in particular, we've actually secured more growth in the largest of the asset managers. They're obviously winning when you look at the external data. And either less growth or in some cases, decline in the midsize and smaller asset managers. And so what -- and that gap can be -- that gap in a particular quarter or a year could be a 2-percentage point growth gap. It could be a 3- or 4-percentage point growth gap. It bounces around. And so what we're finding is that we really feel like we have the right coverage and intensity and kind of seniority focus on the largest of our clients. But our midsized clients are really an important part of our franchise. We built our franchise on them. We provide really, I think, outstanding products and capabilities. And we're finding -- we need to spend both senior time on the midsized clients as well as the time of our relationship managers and client executives. 
And so this is really about intensifying our coverage of those groups and helping them see the strength and the opportunities and the products and services that we can offer, and make sure we're top of mind that we're building on share of wallet. I've got share of wallet statistics for top 250 clients, and that includes the midsized players. And really executing in that area, day in, day out, product 1, product 2, product 30, product 50, it's literally down at that level of granularity where we're focused now.",neutral,0.1976,0.0348,0.7676
15,Adam Quincy Beatty,,"Excellent. That's helpful in the dynamics. And then just a quick follow-up on MBS prepays. I appreciate the detail from before on that. Recognizing, of course, that interest rates will be the main driver there, do you feel as though this past year, 2020, there was any type of pull forward in prepayments or refinancing, such that a reversal and downward tick in rates might not generate the same level of prepays as previously? Or is it very much still linked to rates?",neutral,0.1108,0.1192,0.77
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Adam, it's Eric. I always like to hope that prepayments are burning through, that there's been a onetime pop and then they're going to attenuate. But I've learned that hoping isn't a strategy, right? We just have to operate through the environment. I think what we've seen is certainly a surge of prepayments starting in the end of 2Q, right, once people figured out how to do the paperwork during COVID in 3Q and 4Q. And our best estimate is informed by the various modeling providers, we subscribe to 3 or 4 of them because we need that diversity of opinion, suggest that prepayment speeds should probably continue into the first quarter. And then will begin to edge down from there in the second quarter and the third quarter with some stepwise improvement. 
That said, we've got -- I think we've got to live through time here and just see how it plays out, and we'll know more. What we're trying to do though is make sure that we're always taking the actions that we can on investment portfolio, on deposit reinvestment, on loans, because that's something we can control, and we need to stay focused on those actions.",neutral,0.2908,0.0896,0.6196
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0346,0.0383,0.9271
26,Ryan Michael Kenny,,This is Ryan Kenny on behalf of Betsy. So we saw the OCC stablecoin approval come through earlier this month. Just wondering if that has any impact on State Street and how you're thinking about your blockchain strategy going forward.,neutral,0.0464,0.0344,0.9192
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes. Ryan, this is Ron. In terms of direct impact, first, the OCC doesn't regulate us. And secondly, it directly impacts or, if you will, poses most challenge to the payments banks. For us, in general, it's probably neutral to positive because anything that stimulates more interest in blockchain and particularly more interest in digital currency is going to create a custody opportunity for us, and we have been investing fairly significantly in that space. 
As we've said in the past, blockchain itself is actually quite an important part of lots of things that we're doing in custody and asset servicing. And increasingly, we see digital coins, cryptocurrency as part of the holdings within our client base, and we'll continue to invest in that. But the OCC's work itself is, I would say, not directly relevant to us at this time.",neutral,0.1101,0.0139,0.876
26,Ryan Michael Kenny,,And then one quick other question. Wondering how we should think about the impact from money market fee waivers in 2021. Is it in the run rate now? Or should we expect any uptick from here?,neutral,0.0676,0.077,0.8553
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Ryan, it's Eric. A good part of it is in the run rate. I think we said about $3 million in 4Q. We do expect it to tick up 1 more step, and we're now expecting about $5 million to $10 million a quarter in the coming years. So I think we're much less exposed than others. We don't have retail money market funds. We don't have high net worth funds with higher fees. So -- but those are the figures.",neutral,0.1029,0.0437,0.8534
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0374,0.0419,0.9207
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Eric, maybe just to continue on the net interest income guide for '21. Just -- if you can just talk about your earning asset assumptions for the year and deposit growth strategy, realizing, obviously, they spiked up in 4Q but as you're building your servicing business and you're trying to enhance some of the deposit strategies. Maybe if you could talk about that and your assumptions for '21. And then in fact, also on the premium amortization, I think, you said, $35 million from 3Q to 4Q. So is that about a $170 million level? I just wanted fact check that.",neutral,0.2302,0.0142,0.7556
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Brian, it's Eric. Let me do those in reverse order. I think the -- what -- the $35 million was the headwind we're seeing on a quarterly basis from 4Q -- from 3Q to 4Q in the investment portfolio. And that was a combination of the investment yield grind down and actually higher premium amortization because we're still living through that wave. What I then said is that 4Q to 1Q, we thought the combination of the investment portfolio headwind, including premium amortization would be about a $25 million headwind. And then I said starting in second quarter, we thought it would trend down even further to closer to $10 million, $15 million and $10 million in those out quarters each quarter. So I think what we're starting to see is an attenuation or have that expectation, which partly is the kind of tractor of the investment portfolio playing through and partly lower levels of premium amortization expected as speeds begin to edge downwards. 
In terms of the deposit forecast and the earning asset strategy. On deposits, it's really hard to gauge. The Fed continues to expand the money supplied by, what, about $120 billion a month. We're a 1% or 2% of the deposits. So we pick up deposits just by being here every month. So there's some amount of tailwind. It's just really hard to read, given lots of talk about stimulus bills, asset allocation and reallocation from risk to risk on to risk off to barbelling. So I think right now, we're assuming that we're going to at least stay at these fourth quarter level of average deposits with probably a little bit of edging up. And so we're not at this point expecting yet another surge, but you just don't know, and I think we'll obviously respond as it happens. 
In terms of asset strategy, that's a tough one. I think it's tough for us and for every other bank because we can certainly take some risk on the curve, but you don't get paid very much for it. And so I think there's a balance that we're making, which is how much dry powder do you want to keep. And so then when you do see a spike of interest rates, you can edge or leg into that at a higher and better return versus forsaking some income in the short term. And we're -- our investors are always kind of carefully thinking about that, trying to be opportunistic and will come and go. And we'll do that in treasuries around the curve. MBS, you've seen us build up our MBS book over the last year by a solid $10 billion. I think we want to just be careful there. We want to -- we prefer some of the prepayment-protected subsegments. We've done a little bit of credit. We want to be careful there too, because credit is impacted during the CCAR and SCB process. So it's a pretty diversified approach, I think is the core of our strategy, looking for opportunities, and I think as we see some of those, we'll act, and we'll certainly report on them to all of you.",negative,0.0658,0.5428,0.3913
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,That's great color. And then on the -- just back to the $1.5 trillion that you mentioned of growth servicing wins to offset some of the headwinds. Can you talk about the cross-sell portion of that? So this would be adding different new services to existing clients. Maybe how that's sort of tracking within that outlook. And then also the importance of SSGA's indexing business as they cross-sell to asset servicing clients.,neutral,0.1002,0.0145,0.8853
48,Ronald Philip O’Hanley,,"Yes, Brian, it's Ron. Cross-sell is a very big piece of this. I mean, if you think about what Eric said earlier, you look at 2020 performance, it was largely the same in 2019. The fastest-growing segment or the segment that accounted for the most growth was, in fact, our global client division, which is our largest client. So by definition, we weren't adding many to that, if any. But what we were doing was growing substantially in there. And that will be a key part of our growth going forward for both traditional asset servicing products as some of these providers continue to consolidate -- some of these institutions continue to consolidate providers, but also for front-to-back Alpha activities as we install -- either fully install Alpha or even put Charles River in, in a situation where we have the middle and the back office, but not the front. So that's a key part of it. 
And as we think about the numbers, certainly, the ability to have common clients where we're both the asset servicer and the indexer is attractive. We always look for those opportunities. That's not in the assumption that Eric is describing there. So what we really were trying to do here in response to many questions we've gotten is more or less dimension of what we need to do to grow revenue. Obviously, that number, it's based on averages. So to the extent to which in a given year or a given quarter, we're bringing in higher fee kinds of assets, then obviously, the $1.5 trillion goes down. So that's the way to think about it. You could never, at the end of any particular quarter, say, well, if you're not a quarter of the way there, are you making it or not making -- you got to go 1 click down and see what was the nature of the kind of underlying business, which you'll be able to understand from us.",neutral,0.0728,0.0388,0.8884
0,Operator,,Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.,neutral,0.0384,0.0386,0.923
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"You called out some reduced client activity as pressuring servicing fees in the fourth quarter. Just wondering how that played out with respect to expectations. And then more qualitatively, the level of client activity you're thinking about into the outlook for next year -- well, this year 2021.",neutral,0.0892,0.4091,0.5017
45,Eric Walter Aboaf,,"Yes, Rob. It's Eric. There are a number of features in how we quantify the growth kind of headwinds, tailwinds of our servicing business. Client activity is one of those that fluctuates and really represents some of the trading volumes of our clients because there's some tolling that we do for that. In particular, cash and derivative trades tend to have more likely have tolls than others just because they're a little more complicated. ETF creation, redeem that kind of stuff. So it's a part of our fee schedules that we try to quantify, but it has a long list of kind of volumetric elements. 
I think on a year-on-year basis, 4Q '20 versus a year ago, that -- those -- some of the client activity volumes actually trended down. So servicing fees, it was worth about percentage point of servicing fee headwinds. That's an example of a time it hits against us. For full year 2020, it was actually a positive of almost 2 percentage points. So we saw that as a tailwind. And obviously, the -- all the activity in first quarter, second quarter, in particular, was helpful. 
Next year, we're going to have to lap ourselves on that. So it'll probably be a 1% headwind. So it's got that kind of effect. And what it does is it reminds us that everything matters in our business to drive growth, right? If there's an equity market tailwind or headwind that matters, this client activity matters as well. Net new business, right, in particular, I referenced kind of the importance of gross new sales matters. And then there's always the normalized fee headwinds. And the good news on that last one is that those have normalized back to something pretty close to historical levels.",neutral,0.0851,0.3179,0.597

And our view was that given the role that we play as a custodian as well as our own Alpha product that this was a good initiative to hang around, if you will. We also have clients that are part of it. But it's just very early days in terms of how that's going to develop.
