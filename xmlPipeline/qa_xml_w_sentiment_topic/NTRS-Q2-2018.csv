0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0499,0.0229,0.9272
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Just -- maybe just to start out with the balance sheet and just look at sort of the growth maybe on a year-over-year basis. The deposit levels have come down a little bit on a year-over-year basis. Maybe if you can just talk about sort of what you're seeing on deposit behavior in the Wealth Management segment and -- versus your C&IS segment and think about how we should think about balance sheet growth going forward given you certainly have a lot of capacity -- capital capacity. And then, your use of borrowed funds as well does -- have doubled on a year-over-year basis, so maybe just talk about the strategy behind that as well.",neutral,0.0684,0.3737,0.5579
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Okay. I'll start with question one around the balance sheet and the growth and I'll focus first on the Wealth Management deposits. We have seen that level come down a bit. I think it's -- there are a couple of factors that we would highlight there. 
First is, obviously, we've moved into an increasing rate environment. And those clients, particularly our clients at the higher end of the wealth spectrum, have an array of opportunities to invest their cash. It could be on our balance sheet and we do what we can to provide competitive pricing and opportunity on our balance sheet, but they also may be looking at cash funds and/or other investments to deploy their cash. So when we've seen that -- over the span of a year, we've seen those balances move. Most of those, more than half, about 2/3 have moved somewhere inside of The Northern Trust into either cash funds or other products and capabilities where we've seen those move internally. 
The second thing on the deposit side which we see sequentially in the second quarter is we do see some sequential moves for tax purposes and that's -- we've seen that seasonally in the past. So on the Wealth deposits, while we've seen some of that come down on the Wealth side, it's really the deployment of that and, in some cases, that just moved from balance sheet to other funds at The Northern Trust. Some, approximately 1/3 or so as we described it, could have moved to other products somewhere outside of The Northern. 
We remain competitive. We track our peer set closely and do what we can to ensure that our pricing remains competitive to attract and pay on those wealth deposits because they're very valuable deposits as you know. 
On the institutional side, I would say that those deposit balances can demonstrate a little more volatility based on, A, our growth profile. We grow and they go up, but those are large sophisticated asset owners who may deploy those assets into the market at any time -- an opportune time. A meaningful portion are very operational in nature, but we can see some movement in that from quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. 
The pricing on those, the competitive nature of the pricing on those, we have fewer competitors than we do in the Wealth, but it's a little less transparent. So we monitor and have dialogues with our clients and do what we can to price those deposits appropriately. As you might imagine, some clients are on pre-negotiated rates and some are on standard rate cards. And again, we monitor that closely. We're competitive in the world in deposits and we will be in both spaces and continue to be competitive. 
I think, generally, the growth on our balance sheet that we've seen over time has just been the success of our business growth strategy. You've seen high single to low double-digit growth rates in our firm and fees and that generally manifest itself in, over time, a growing balance sheet.",neutral,0.0908,0.0627,0.8466
34,Mark M. Bette,,Short-term funds.,neutral,0.0239,0.0329,0.9432
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"And then short-term borrowed funds, there's -- the second part of that, I would say what we do -- because of our strong capital levels, we have the ability to do some discretionary leveraging, which does produce incremental net interest income for our shareholders. And given our financial strength and the leverage or lack of leverage constraints that we have as you see in our results, it's allowed us to utilize that. It can have the added benefit, the borrowed funds, of helping the LCR as we manage that so it does add to that. Those borrowed funds where we typically borrow can have the added benefit of helping out on the LCR as well.",positive,0.5525,0.0106,0.4369
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"That's super helpful. And maybe just a follow-up, just the organic growth, we've had -- obviously had some headwinds on the FX side and the market returns were mixed on a sequential basis, but if we look at the actual AUM in Wealth Management, if you can just talk about your general organic growth in Wealth Management maybe in the second quarter versus, say, to the first quarter and a year-over-year basis?",neutral,0.1121,0.0922,0.7956
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. I'll start maybe -- well, I'll talk the whole firm first. The organic growth rate, which we fairly consistently have been talking about in fees, has been -- we've talked about in the mid-single digits. Let's call it the 4% to 5% range. We, again, had a quarter where we were in that range, we saw. 
Specifically to Wealth, we did see some slowing of the organic growth rate in Wealth from first to second quarter and, again, that was impacted less by gross new business than it was by flows. And the flows, if we think about it, can have things like tax payments in the first quarter when -- early second quarter, excuse me, on tax day and/or deployment of that cash and/or investment in the markets and/or potentially even loan pay downs as second homes or other items have become less tax-attractive. Those combined could create some flow pressures on values and AUM inside of our portfolios, but generally, the gross new business portion of that organic growth continue to be very strong in the business.",neutral,0.184,0.2951,0.5209
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,neutral,0.0386,0.0328,0.9286
41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Maybe just one more on the net interest revenue outlook. Just how should we be thinking about it for the rest of the year in terms of balance sheet growth given that it doesn't seem like maybe there's a lot of demand, but you're able to use the short-term funding? And then, if we do get another rate hike, what's the expectations in terms of that flowing through either to the NIM?",neutral,0.1187,0.0209,0.8605
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So if we -- we obviously don't give guidance, but if I look at the impacts of a future hike, what I would say is the first thing we've got to look at is the asset side of the balance sheet for us. And I would say you can see that we remain asset-sensitive. We are heavily impacted by short-term rates, 1-month LIBOR primarily and 3 months LIBOR moving. So if those move up with a rate hike, which they would likely, the asset sensitivity remains in the balance sheet as you can see via a relatively low duration. So I think the asset side still has sensitivity to rate moves. 
Then we go to the important factor, which is what happens with the liability pricing in that. And what I would just say there is we're doing our best to be both disciplined in our pricing on the liability side, but we also need to be competitive. So we have to be both. And you have a view on what the competition is doing and others do. We monitor them as well and we remain competitive. It's important for us to be competitive in that landscape. I think we want to be a disciplined firm. I think you can see that in our betas and others, but we also have to be competitive. Our clients expect and deserve competitive rates and we will be mindful of the market when we do that. 
So the betas haven't reached 1. So they are expensive to at least the NIM. And then the second part of your question was on the balance sheet side. That's a reflection of our new business opportunities and some of the nuances of where our clients are either deploying cash or elsewhere. So I'm certainly not going to be able to give you a projection on that, but I did give you some of our thinking on how we think the asset and liability side could move.",neutral,0.0869,0.0448,0.8683
41,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Got it, okay. And just as a follow-up, on the FX -- on the trading income, you mentioned the swaps again this quarter. Just, I don't know if you mentioned the magnitude, but just wanted to get some color because we saw the activity. But maybe like -- I know it's volatile [indiscernible] lumpy in the quarter.",neutral,0.1037,0.1771,0.7193
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So you're right. So if we looked at our FX total of $78 million, $79 million, approximately $18 million of that was from the treasury swap. But remember, as we said last quarter -- and that was largely swapping dollars into euros, and that drove a positive FX variance. As you might imagine, that actually hurt or suppressed net interest income to the tune of about $14 million. So the trade produced $18 million of FX at the expense, if you will, of $14 million of NII. That trade, if you look at sort of a euro-dollar swap kind of curve or something like that, you can see that spread has narrowed some. So it is possible that in the quarter, if that maintains, you could see some redistribution between FX, that $18 million in NII in the quarter.  We'll provide better color later in the quarter as we see that unfold. So I would say that's generally what we've seen on the FX trade. Our core FX supporting our clients was actually up 20% year-over-year when we look at what we would consider our traditional FX support of our asset servicing business as well. So good trends in both of those components.",negative,0.3199,0.5411,0.1391
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0399,0.0336,0.9265
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So a question on expenses for you guys. So I heard your $92 million of annualized kind of run rate expenses [indiscernible] [ $250 ] million in 2Q. I think that's up from $55 million last quarter. So I guess, can you walk us through the pace of realizations for the remaining of this year and how we should be thinking about it for 2019? And I guess, secondly, as I think about it, I guess, sort of the jumping off point for expenses, backing out severance, it looks like you guys are around $990 million for this quarter. Other than the Northern Open, is there anything else we need to be mindful of as we think about 3Q expenses specifically?",neutral,0.2677,0.0638,0.6685
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"So I'll take those in 2 parts, right? The first is on Value for Spend and the run rate. Alex, the answer on that is we continue to have a really strong pipeline of opportunities to get after, and we're getting after it as fast as we can. So the pacing of that, you did see some acceleration in there. And the team here remains focused on getting after it as fast as we can. I know we have talked about it being fairly evenly distributed over 3 years. We're going as fast as we can. And if we exceed that expectation, we're happy. But we also are getting after some of the things that have the quickest and -- I won't say easy because none of them were easy, but the fastest return. But we continue to look at an array of opportunities. So we think and are committed to that $250 million. So can't give you much more on that front. In terms of the third quarter, we gave you the Northern Trust Open. I would say the only other item in the quarter is we have actually some modest decline in equity incentives from, I think, we had 11 in this quarter, Mark...",positive,0.5626,0.281,0.1564
34,Mark M. Bette,,That's right.,neutral,0.1249,0.0318,0.8434
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"And then we should see some modest decline in the equity incentives as they ratchet down during the course of the year. I'd say other than that, it would be nothing that you wouldn't jump off. And your run rate of jumping off at $991 million was  -- is -- $990 million, $991 million is reasonable.",negative,0.0767,0.7748,0.1484
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it, great. And then just as a quick follow-up on [ cost but slightly on the cost ] . Credit, not a huge deal, obviously, but we've seen you guys put up a negative provision for many quarters. The first time it turned positive. Obviously, credit remains quite benign. So maybe just kind of what's going on there would be helpful.",neutral,0.255,0.0434,0.7016
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. So we had one credit that we had a specific reserve for that drove it, one individual credit. So we would not see any trends unique, and credit quality remains at a very strong and positive levels. And that's about all I could say that we have very, very strong credit quality right now in the cycle.",neutral,0.4788,0.0193,0.5019

35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. Ken, let me walk you through that real quick, if I could. I think that's a good question. If we took the charges out of the second quarter from last year and the charges out of this quarter, we think the expense growth rate would have been closer to 8%. I would take 2 points of that out for UBS is attributable to UBS. Currency is about 0.5 point.

12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay, got it. And that's all right. And then that's a -- well, we'll see what happens going forward to your points about the comp comparisons, but Northern Trust and the comps [indiscernible] those are year-over-year things that were already in there, right? So it's really just about how the business grows in terms of that rate of growth from here?",neutral,0.0618,0.0261,0.9121

12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay, perfect. Great. And then just a question on just core business and wins and such. Obviously, the markets were down, so -- and it looked like the global piece was more of a negative in terms of the AUC, if I look at the global assets under custody. Can you just talk us through just what type of win quarter it was in terms of new assets put on? And any updates on your just kind of underlying growth pipeline will be great.",neutral,0.101,0.0705,0.8284
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes, we continue across both businesses to see a strong new business opportunities, and we highlight some of those with press releases, very strong. In the AUC piece, particularly the sequential comparator, the currency was really a pretty meaningful driver of what was flattish sequential. It was, I think, about 2 points of a currency impact. As you remember, we have a fairly significant global custody asset mix of our AUC, so we have a lot in other currencies. I think about 65% is in dollars but 35% isn't. And so the currency impact was pretty meaningful. So I know you asked about the new business trends, but in the AUC specifically, I would say that the currency was a meaningful driver. It more than offset market and new business uplifts in the quarter. We continue to have significant pipelines and healthy, healthy growth opportunities in both businesses.",positive,0.5662,0.0248,0.409
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.,neutral,0.038,0.0338,0.9283
36,Marlin Lacey Mosby,,"So you know where I'm heading. If you look at your NII number, it only represents 28% of your revenues, but it actually generates about 82% of your bottom line pretax profit. So it's a pretty important portion of what you manage. We've got the data now that show that look, interest-bearing deposits rates haven't increased precipitously. You may get a little bit more as we think you will get elasticity from here forward, so you'll get that low curve. DDAs have been relatively sticky, so it's not like they're running off in big portions. And yet, we still have $25 billion sitting in cash, and we got a duration on our securities portfolio that's probably about a year and a half. So at some point in the cycle, we need to defend against the next cycle, which is when rates come down and which that 82% of our profits get squeezed. So I just wanted to kind of put that back out there again and see how you're thinking about that in ALCO and what timing of that you might be looking at.",neutral,0.1502,0.3052,0.5447
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes, thank you, Marty. Well, what I would say is all of the points you made are factors that we contemplate in our ALCO committee. And we meet regularly, and we think about duration management. We think about liquidity management. We think about credit [ and quality ] in the portfolio. We have active and regular dialogues. And I'm certainly mindful of your views on those, and we continue to have active debates about what we should be doing to that portion of the balance sheet on a regular basis. So appreciate your comments.",neutral,0.1012,0.0143,0.8845
36,Marlin Lacey Mosby,,"And you've been continuing to roll the expenses relative to your core business -- core fees down. So where you were -- expenses are still 6% higher, but that is significantly better than what we've seen in the past. The efforts that you have should continue to push that ratio closer to 100%, I would expect, over the next couple of years. So that's the other piece of the initiative that really does create a lot of leverage to the income statement.",positive,0.8981,0.0348,0.0671
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes. We're internally very focused on that measure because we think the majority of our expenses -- the majority, not all, but the majority of our expenses are tied to generating trust fees. So we think it's a very prudent measure. It's not a perfect measure, but it's a very prudent pressure to look at operating leverage in our business and performance leverage in our business, and we continue to drive that down. If you did the calculation in our Wealth Management business, you will see it's actually sub that 100%, and you see that manifest in 41% pretax margin in that business. But there's still opportunity left in there, and we talked about that a little bit in our Value for Spend options, our opportunities, and we're committed to continue to focus on that and drive it to the best levels we can.",neutral,0.2186,0.0303,0.7512

It has remained at that level for 4 to 5 quarters now, so we think that at least a pretty meaningful portion of that is there for operational or other liquidity needs. We haven't seen that move. It could. We talked about that. So I can't predict.

So that will certainly be one of the important factors as we consider that range that we will contemplate. And a quick example would be, in this quarter, you can do this calculation, but effectively, it added about 1.7 points of ROE.

The second is as you might imagine, that is -- it has somewhat constrained the NIM. It is producing incremental NII, which I know is valuable.

We -- I would say, Mike, we would probably look at core revenue was up if I exclude any year-over-year currency or the acquisition would be up mid-11%, so 11% -- a little over 11%. And you're right on, on expenses. So that's what we would look at core revenue and core expenses sort of 11% and 4.5%, something like that.",neutral,0.2973,0.0277,0.675
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"All right, so I think you're going to win the award for greatest operating leverage for the quarter, measured that way. But how should we think about that going ahead? Should we think of some of these expenses being lumpy? Or you don't get 700 basis points of positive operating leverage in 1 quarter with -- I assume, without having not as good of operating leverage in future quarters. You did mention the $17 million of marketing in the third quarter, so I guess, that will impact that though, I guess, you still have that comp year-over-year. So I mean, what kind of operating leverage are you looking for, for this year and on a go-forward basis?",neutral,0.2127,0.0355,0.7518
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Well, I -- there's obviously both the revenue and the expense component to that. So it depends on how markets perform and rate lifts and others. But I know that we're focused on driving operating leverage into the franchise and particularly fee operating leverage into the franchise. So if we look at that, our fees grew somewhere adjusted around 7% if we stripped out all of that noise versus that 4.5%. So we still [ were ] driving 2.5 to 3 points of fee leverage. That is a very important focus. And then the second thing I would say is -- Mike is, we're very focused on organic leverage. So the rate we can organically grow our fees versus the rate that our expenses grow organically. So if our expense growth rate was 4.5%, some of those were inorganic factors in there. So that growth rate would've been lower. And if our fees were, as I've told you, somewhere in that 4% to 5% range, we're getting to that organic fee leverage -- I think we wrote in the script as well. So organic fee leverage, fee operating leverage and total operating leverage remain commonly held discussions around here in terms of focus.",neutral,0.0998,0.0431,0.8571

34,Mark M. Bette,,"Yes. And the one thing, Mike, I would add is the AUA related to the UBS that we called out was $575 billion, which is down sequentially from $607 million, and that was really a currency factor there.

10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"Sticking with the comments on M&A, can you give us your outlook for opportunities? Obviously, the UBS transaction sounds like it's going well. You guys have done a number of deals over the years. Is there anything that you see in the horizon that could look interesting to you, whether it's in a different product line or just enhances an existing product line?",neutral,0.1717,0.0142,0.8141
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"If you look at some announcements that were public, we closed, what I will call, the [ CTEC ] technology, Omnium technology acquisition in the quarter. We talked about an investment in Lumint and others. What we've done is found opportunities, I think, to partner with or work aside or acquire some products and capabilities to get to market quicker and to, I think, create some speed and solutions for our clients. So rather than a large acquisition, that's where we have over the last 2 quarters focused more of our energy and some of our capital in those types of moves. We obviously stay attuned to the market. And should opportunities come up, we pay attention and we get the people that call on us that give us those advices. So I'd say what you've seen in the public domain is more of a targeted smaller acquisitions or investments in products and capabilities or technologies that I think can help  move us forward.",neutral,0.2103,0.014,0.7757
10,Gerard S. Cassidy,,"Very good. And then just going into the organic side, over the years, you've obviously grown organically the private wealth business by expanding into different geographies outside the home base in Chicago. Can you give us an update on what you are thinking over the next 12 to 18 months of potential organic expansion of the private wealth, personal wealth business geographically?",neutral,0.1313,0.0087,0.86
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes, so we are absolutely continuing to look at anywhere where we -- there's a high opportunity set for wealth markets there, pockets along the East Coast where we're -- there's high net worth opportunities where we're underpenetrated. What I would highlight for you though in that strategy is that we don't always need to have a physical location there. There are some markets where virtual teams have covered that, and we've had tremendous success in certain cities where we actually cover them with virtual teams and have been successful with that approach. So we feel pretty good about our coverage in the wealth space, but we will continue to look at those opportunities if we have a geographical gap. But I think we're pretty excited with our model to be able to close that.",positive,0.531,0.0117,0.4573

8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,Just real quick on the new business wins. I know you don't want to quantify the numbers. But can you at least directionally say if it's up or down quarter-on-quarter?,neutral,0.0866,0.2425,0.6709
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Our new -- we don't -- I mean on a year-over-year basis, I would say yes. I mean, I don't know especially when you think about the institutional business quarter-on-quarter. There was a positive impact on the fees, I would say. The actual new business that's recognized can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But there were sequential benefits as well as year-over-year benefits from new business.",neutral,0.2854,0.0365,0.6781
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"And just as you look out for the organic revenue growth, I mean, when you look out at the asset servicing, what's the driver of this organic growth that you're seeing? Is it coming from client switching from other providers? Is it really just the new phase of outsourcing you're seeing picking it up? I mean, can you help us give a better understanding of where it's coming from?",neutral,0.1348,0.0142,0.851
35,Stephen Biff Bowman,,"Yes, sure. Good question. It is -- I would say, we have seen a lot of it in our institutional side has been with asset servicing -- excuse me, asset manager clients providing asset servicing to asset manager clients. And to your point, some of that has been their drive to look at their cost structures in a difficult environment. And so opportunities for middle, back office and/or other places where they can outsource or partner with somebody has driven some of that. Look, many of -- if you're with the right managers, they also have growth. So we get some distributed growth as well. I think that's particularly true in our hedge fund services space, where we've had the opportunity and good fortune to partner with some partners, some clients who've been very successful in growing their own books and therefore our organic growth goes with them as they either launch new funds or grow their AUM themselves. And then geographies, I would add. We've had great growth as we talked about in Australia, but we've had great growth in other regions of the world. The Netherlands has had terrific success. We opened an office in Seoul, South Korea, and other parts of the world. So geographical, it's some distributed growth by partnering with the right folks. And then it's -- the macroeconomic environment is causing some folks to look at outsourcing and/or other opportunities. And that's driven a lot of our C&IS growth. You're right, in the more traditional pension space, that's more of a takeaway game. We do very well in that takeaway game, but there's probably not a lot of new defined benefit plans being open for us. And so it's really a market share kind of game there in which we continue to do well in.",neutral,0.2463,0.0171,0.7366
