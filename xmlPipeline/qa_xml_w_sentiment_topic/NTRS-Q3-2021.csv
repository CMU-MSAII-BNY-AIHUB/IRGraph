0,Operator,,"Certainly, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.",neutral,0.0642,0.0128,0.9229
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"First one is a question on custody and fund administration fees. Usually, we're beating you up and saying, why didn't they grow as much as assets at this time, you had 17% growth, almost kept pace with the 21% growth in assets. So I guess the underlying question is, what's the nature of the new business that you're adding on? How’s that average fee compared to the overall average? And if there's anything else you could add on in there, that would be great because it's interesting.",neutral,0.0731,0.0299,0.8969
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. Well, I'll start, and if Mike wants to jump in. In looking at what's been added on, what was interesting to me is it's a really good blend across geographies and across client channels. And so there's been good business that's been onboarded in EMEA, APAC, but also in North America. And then you look at the client channels, whether it's our traditional Institutional Investor Group, IIG, or our Fund Services group, there's been business that's been onboarded across the board. 
Interestingly, we don't look that much at kind of the average fee per the assets coming on board. We look much more at what are we doing for those clients. And so I think what jumps more to me is how we've been able to continue to build in some of the other ancillary services that we're doing for clients, things overall, like core brokerage and you see FX down mostly because of the summer dynamic, but it's up nicely over year-over-year. Mike, anything to add?",neutral,0.4431,0.0291,0.5279
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"I would just add, Glenn, 2 points. One is that with some of the new business that came online during the quarter, it was -- as Jason mentioned, in North America, it was in fund services and specifically fund administration plus other services related to that. So think about those as kind of full-service clients, to your point, where per dollar of assets is going to be higher. So good client wins on that front. 
And then the second thing is that we also get growth through the, I'll say, success and growth of our clients. And we've seen that particularly in the alternative assets area where they've had good flows and good appreciation and that has flowed through to some of the increase in fees that you've seen for us.",positive,0.5647,0.0219,0.4134
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"That makes a lot of sense. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Now that you mentioned the alternative world. Obviously, it's a big push and ongoing momentum in the high net worth individuals, increasing their allocations to alts. We've seen that in a bunch of the big broker dealers. We've seen the alts getting success in distributing their product. You have a big Wealth Management platform. Can you just talk to us about where you're at in terms of that evolution?",neutral,0.3327,0.0121,0.6552
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"So strategically, we see that as -- it's been successful, to your point, Glenn, but still has a big opportunity for us across the company, so meaning each of our businesses. And with each of those, I would say, we are trying to provide more in the way of services around that. So within Asset Management, our 50 South business is completely focused on providing alternative solutions for our -- both Wealth Management clients, but also institutional clients. 
Certainly, within asset servicing, I mentioned there a little bit alternative asset managers. As you know, we have a relatively meaningful business in hedge funds. With hedge funds, we're looking to expand that more to private capital where, again, we have a strong client base but looking to grow that faster. 
And then also within Wealth Management, if you just look at the asset allocation of our Wealth Management clients. At this point, it would indicate that overall, their allocation to alternatives should be higher over time. And so how can we provide that? We have some solutions on our platform in addition to 50 South, where they can invest directly in alternative funds. But we believe that there's more we can do across the spectrum of clients that we have.",neutral,0.2964,0.0096,0.6941
0,Operator,,Your next question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,neutral,0.0301,0.0395,0.9304
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"So just wanted to start off with a question on organic growth, and maybe specific to the Wealth Management segment. Some of your peers have been citing that flow rates have been running hot, expecting some moderation or normalization in the coming quarters. And was hoping you could speak to where organic growth within the wealth segment is running today? And what you believe is a sustainable flow rate for that business longer term?",neutral,0.1305,0.0224,0.8471
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Well, the -- I'd start with separating the regions from GFO. And in general, over the last several years, the GFO business, which obviously is -- for people that are less familiar than you are, Steve, that serves the very upper end of our market, clients with dedicated family offices. And we think that that matches our brand particularly well. And we've seen strong growth there on a consistent basis. And so within the wealth segment, that's where we've seen higher levels. 
And then I think progressively, the -- in general, the higher the client base in terms of assets, that's where we've done well. And so that's been a continued theme for us. And as we look year-over-year, there's -- we've always talked about the fact that wealth will be lower organic growth relative to C&IS through a cycle, but still positive, and that's what we've seen even if we look year-over-year.",positive,0.5652,0.0689,0.3659
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"I would just add, there's also a tremendous amount of activity right now, which difficult to predict how that will continue. But when you think about family-owned businesses and other liquidity events for business owners, that wealth creation, where it goes from a business to being liquid wealth creates the opportunity for us to work with those clients in a different way. And so there's been a high level of activity on that front. And we'll see what happens through the end of the year here, potential tax changes, things like that that generally creates opportunity for us.",neutral,0.3131,0.0198,0.6671
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"That's great. And just for my follow-up on the NII outlook, certainly encouraging to see the uptick in securities yields in the quarter. And just curious if the forward curve holds, have we reached a point where we've lapped reinvestment headwinds? And just bigger picture in terms of the NII outlook more broadly, given strong loan growth and improving rate backdrop, should we expect to now grow off the current NII base level?",positive,0.8708,0.0465,0.0826
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"So we're still -- we're not fully all the way through from an NII perspective. The whole balance sheet is, call it, 85% to 90% through. But obviously, we're not quite all the way there yet from a securities perspective. We're getting close. We're still losing, I'd call it, based on the reinvestment rates right now, about $1 million a quarter in reinvestment. But that's going to eventually taper off. 
And it's not as big of an impact as it was a year ago, obviously, just having $1 million a quarter drag. And so you're right in that from here, mostly the drivers are going to be based on what's happening in the business. And so you saw strong loan growth and other factors of where we're investing be the key drivers of the movement in NII. And the drag from reinvestment is definitely much, much lower than what it was before.",negative,0.1418,0.4533,0.405
0,Operator,,And your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0337,0.0389,0.9274
6,Brennan Hawken,,"I'd like to follow up on Steven's question, and his point, I think, is really fair. We've seen a pretty significant acceleration from a lot of the wealth management firms, and it's happening broadly. It's happening in the mass affluent space. It's happening in the high net worth space. It doesn't seem like you guys have seen a similar magnitude of acceleration. But we're not sure because we don't get the granular disclosure. 
So number one, could you maybe juxtapose -- do you juxtapose your growth versus some of those peers? And then maybe if the growth hasn't accelerated the way we've seen it, some of the others, why do you think that is? Do you think it's because you were focused on ultra-high net worth? Do you think it has something to do with your approach, and how you market to clients where face-to-face meetings are a lot more important? What do you think might be going on there?",neutral,0.0796,0.0336,0.8868
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"You're starting, right?",neutral,0.0959,0.0197,0.8844
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"So I'll start. And I think, to your point, our business is different than what I would call the broad market for wealth managers. And as we've talked about many times, we're more focused upmarket where some of that activity can be lumpier, if you will, where there are large transactions that either our clients are a part of or large wins where we're bringing on new clients with very meaningful wealth. 
And so I think in that sense, you are going to have different dynamics that happen there. Now we do internally track closely the flows and the revenues that are coming in from the different types of clients. And as much as there's been some variability in the proportion that's coming from the ultra-high net worth versus the high net worth, it's still relatively steady. So I would say, to your point, we are participating in this very kind of broad base, whether we're participating as much as any one of the other particular competitors, I can't speak to. But on the higher end, it has its own set of dynamics.",neutral,0.0708,0.0311,0.8981
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. And Jason, you’ve recently flagged some upward expense pressure at an industry conference, which has been a big focus for investors. So understand that, it's probably too early to get much of a sense for magnitude on that front. But if it is possible to try to frame the magnitude, that would be helpful, number one. And number two, even with that upward pressure, is the commitment and the focus still on generating fee revenue, operating leverage or organic operating leverage ex the fee waivers?",neutral,0.1082,0.031,0.8608
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Thanks. I don't want to ramble, would it be helpful for me to just give a little bit of an overview expenses in general? Or do you want me to just stay specifically on the -- on kind of what happened with technology, equipment and services outside services?",neutral,0.0312,0.0459,0.9229
6,Brennan Hawken,,No. It's much more about the outlook and thinking about next year versus what's happened here recently.,neutral,0.0682,0.0509,0.8809
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sounds good. So we mentioned historically that we think about expenses in 4 categories. There's inflation, efficiencies, investments and growth. So just keep that framework in mind, and I'll give some of the key themes that we're thinking about as we're thinking about 2022 expenses. 
So first, inflation is going to hit in a couple of areas. Mike talked earlier about the pressures we're feeling there. In comp, we're going to see higher growth levels. Every firm is talking about the challenges of retaining and attracting top talent, we’re no different. So this will hit -- it's affecting the salary base now but it's going to continue to embed over time, and we'll see a larger-than-historical adjustment in second quarter when our normal base pay adjustments actually hit. It also, though -- it affects incentives, and that's already hitting the income statement. We've got -- there's a higher incentive accrual in third quarter of 2021 as we're addressing these issues. 
And then secondly, as you talked -- you highlighted kind of the equipment, software and outside services line, which I think are -- we should really talk about those in concert with one another because there's some movement between those lines. And we want to -- we're going to continue investing in strengthening the technology foundation given that we've got the digital transformation that's happening in Wealth Management and everything we want to do to maximize defenses against cyber threats. That means equipment, software and outside services are going to -- they'll continue to be on a higher growth rate relative to the other expense categories. Now just remember, about half of those lines are tied to business growth, but we're going to see the foundational element of those continue to be invested in. 
The third theme I'd call out is -- call it, a return to normal. And that's going to touch on occupancy and then travel, which hits in other operating expenses. We're going to be on the road more often, and that will hit out that line item. And we're not going to likely get to pre-COVID levels, but -- by the end of next year, but that will be significantly higher. 
And then the last theme is on efficiency actions. And we embedded efficiency and productivity targets into our plan every year. We made a big push on efficiency this year with the staff actions. We took out 400 roles, mostly in North America. And that drove the savings we talked about of about $50 million. We're going to continue to push for opportunities across all the expense categories to find efficiencies. But those are the big 4 themes that have been on my mind is -- in our minds, not mine, all of our mines as we talk -- as we start to talk about 2022. So hopefully, that's helpful in giving you a little bit of an outlook of how we're thinking about expenses.",neutral,0.2653,0.0261,0.7086
6,Brennan Hawken,,"It is helpful. Just the last piece to remind you about is the fee operating leverage, like despite this pressure, is that still committed?",neutral,0.0847,0.0243,0.8911
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Thank you so much for reminding me of that because that is -- it's super important. And I think a lot of people try and think about, are Northern's expenses is going to be flat, up? It depends. We consider ourselves still a growth company. We want to drive revenue growth. And so that fourth element of the framework I gave in the beginning of those comments around growth -- if we're growing expenses because of that -- because we've got good revenue growth, that's fine. That's good. And so the key thing we look at when we put all that together, what is the operating leverage look like for the company.",neutral,0.1285,0.0269,0.8446
0,Operator,,"And next, we'll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.",neutral,0.0322,0.025,0.9428
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"Just follow up from the last question. I'm not sure you answered that last question. Maybe that was intentional because you're going to wait. So do you think you'll have the operating leverage based on fees relative to expenses, even with the higher comp, T&E and cyber. But the general question is, where are you on the broader investing curve? I mean head count this year should probably grow only by about 1%. And for the prior 5 years, it grew by about 5%. So that's a dramatic reduction in the number of people that you're adding. So it looks like a lot more productivity. So the question is, how much is that driven from technology and it's sustainable and it should help drive positive operating leverage in the future? And how much is simply more productive employees might cost more in the future?",positive,0.3578,0.3007,0.3415
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"So Mike, I'm going to start with that because you've highlighted, I think, a really important dynamic, which is we have seen this meaningful increase in productivity. That said, looking at the drivers of that, yes, some of it is from technology that has enabled us to automate activities and other initiatives that we've been executing on for some time period. That said, another driver is the type market for talent. And so -- and just the remote working environment. It's changed the operating environment. And to your point or question on sustainability, my judgment would be that it's a little tight. It's too tight at this point. 
So we've continued to grow as Jason highlighted. Some of that growth, yes, comes through the markets. But we've also added new clients, net new business for us. We've added people. As a part of that, we've tried to do it very efficiently. But also it's been a heavy burden, I would just say, on the employees to be able to deliver that in a remote working environment. And so back to this broader question on what we're driving towards. It's profitable growth, which does mean growing fees, growing revenue faster than we're growing our expense base with that. 
Now in any quarter, in any year, it can ebb and flow a little bit, but that's the objective over time. And when we look at the profitability in this quarter, whether you want to look at the ROE, the pretax margin or the fees to expenses. They're all at pretty attractive levels. Could they be better, particularly on the pretax margin if the rate environment changes? Absolutely, and we'd like to see that. But we think we're operating pretty efficiently today, certainly look to do more, but we're in an unusual operating environment.",neutral,0.3199,0.0257,0.6544
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"And then one related question. As far as the investments in your back office, which you retooled, as it relates to the cloud, I think you are more conservative with your plans to move more workload to the public cloud. And I'm just curious as to why the more conservatism on your part versus some other financial firms?",neutral,0.0626,0.0371,0.9003
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"So I would say we -- our cloud strategy is absolutely focused and tailored to our business, our client base. And so the pace or how it would be characterized, Mike, relative to somebody else could be viewed differently. I don't have a problem with that. We're looking at how does it fit with what we're doing. Given the nature of our client base and what we do for them, yes, we are highly sensitized to all the potential impacts and risks of a transition like that. 
Now with that said, we have been very focused, first, on the private cloud. And beyond the fact that that's been a strategy that we've been executing on for years. In this past year, we completely upgraded the capabilities of the private cloud for us and have many, many of our applications and activities in the private cloud. 
As far as public cloud, we're taking a hybrid cloud approach to that. To your point, I would say, being thoughtful about how we do it, and we are still in the earlier stages of the actual transition of applications and activities into the public cloud. The strategy is there to continue to do that, but in a thoughtful, secure, stable way for our business and for our clients.",neutral,0.1951,0.0144,0.7904
0,Operator,,"Next, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.",neutral,0.0324,0.02,0.9476
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Jason, can you give us some color on -- you had real good loan growth this quarter sequentially. Just what was driving the loan growth? And then, also with the balance sheet, your average deposits, you pointed out, grew sequentially, but the period end numbers fell. So maybe if you could give us some color on that as well.",neutral,0.3393,0.0791,0.5815
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So let me start with loan growth. Two buckets. One is in the personal side. And again, in that bucket, those are extremely -- those can be extremely high net worth clients that want to use our balance sheet to solve for liquidity needs. And the reason I highlight that is because it can be very volatile and unpredictable, but roughly half of the sequential increase came from that general bucket. 
The second bucket is commercial, which was about the other half. And that's more stable, and that's been in various areas, but we've talked about going to our existing clients and doing more of the existing loan types with them, but explaining to them that we've got appetite to do more with them. And part of our business model, not just financial model, is to grow with our clients. 
And I think that's one of the things that's driven our loan growth as our clients have been -- they've been active. And we've told them we're happy to participate with them more in those ways. And so that's hit on the commercial line. And so again, I think part of it is the base there is -- it has definitely risen. But part of it is more -- is -- some components that might be more volatile over time. 
And then on deposit volumes, as you know well, because I know you follow this closely, that can also just be volatile. And we've got -- our clients will -- they’ll call us and ask to put not millions, but sometimes hundreds of millions or billions of dollars on the balance sheet. And so we don't -- we tend not to look at the deposit at the quarter end balances. I do look coming into the quarter and after the quarter, how they trend and this quarter, well, it didn't look very different in terms of how balances trended coming in or out. So I didn't overread the dynamic that you mentioned of the average versus quarter end.",neutral,0.1036,0.0449,0.8515
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Very good. And then you and your peers have had strong year-over-year growth in your fee revenues. You've talked about it already on this call. Can you pull out for us, what percentage would you attribute the growth in the custody fees and the Wealth Management fees that is from market appreciation versus new business or additional flows from clients? Can you parse through that?",positive,0.7105,0.0101,0.2794
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. So I can split it, let's just start. We do year-over-year. And if we think about the C&IS business, there's, I'd say, a good chunk has come from markets, call it, high -- mid to high single digit. And then there's also the organic or net new business and other dynamics would represent the rest. And that adds up overall to kind of, again, mid to high single digits, but a little bit less, call it, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%.",neutral,0.0763,0.0173,0.9063
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"That's on total C&IS trust fees, right. Yes?",neutral,0.0338,0.0347,0.9315
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Yes. And then on wealth, I can do the same type of split for you and a little bit more weighted toward market there, which is that's had an impact that's stronger. If we look year-over-year, more like 15%, 20% type. And the organic piece, if I add it up, also strong, but more in the low single-digit range on a percentage basis.",neutral,0.1515,0.0146,0.8338
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,And the waivers are certainly in that mix too.,neutral,0.076,0.0288,0.8952
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,Yes.,neutral,0.1082,0.0226,0.8692
0,Operator,,And your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0313,0.028,0.9407
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"I had a question just a bit more strategic to kick off on how you're thinking about the returns that you're going to be generating from the investments you're making today in the various sleeves and across the globe. I'm just wondering if we think about where we are today versus pre-COVID, has the return profile changed much for your incremental investment spend?",neutral,0.0779,0.0234,0.8987
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"Yes. Betsy, I wouldn't necessarily say that the return profile has changed. In many respects, what I think has been interesting through the crisis here is that although there was a pause in some of the execution of projects and programs around investments in the initial stages of the pandemic. It picked up pretty quickly thereafter. And instead of groups all being in one room, working together on the digital project, they figured out how to do it by Webex, Zoom or Teams. 
So in that sense, we've continued to make really good progress on investments such as -- just to give you an example, the digitalization of our Wealth Management business where there's a number of components to that journey, as we call it. And so that progress has been very good. And I'd say, in general, to your point on the timing or the profile for the returns on that should be similar to what we would have expected when we started it. 
The one thing I would say is just the characterization or the character, if you will, of investments in the different businesses. I talked earlier in the call about launching new funds in Asset Management, for example. So there's meaningful investment that goes into product development. And again, throughout the last couple of years here, they've continued to put out new products. And then it takes some time period for those to obviously build AUM, but then are very profitable over time. That profile is very different than asset servicing, where a lot of the investment -- the return you're going to get is nearer term. In the sense of bringing on a large client, there's some integration, transition costs with that. But then once that's up and running, essentially, you're getting the return for that investment. 
And then finally, just Wealth Management, I talked about some additions that we've made, not just in the last quarter, but could go back. And there, you're hiring people and teams that are in different parts of the country. Again, it takes a little bit of time for them to get on and get acclimated, but they're productive relatively quickly as well. So we look at all of those when we put together both our longer-term strategic planning, but also the annual plan.",neutral,0.118,0.0229,0.8591
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then just a little more nitty-gritty. I'm wondering if there's any update on how you're thinking about the reinvesting the expenses that have been associated with the golf tournament. Is that going to flow through in other types of marketing? Or is that really get thrown into the bigger bucket of opportunity set, and we could see that migrate into other areas of investment, not specifically around that sleeve of client that you've been investing in with the golf tournament.",neutral,0.0569,0.0222,0.9209
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"Yes. The way I would characterize it, Betsy, is the golf tournament was a great opportunity for us to build our brand and particularly focused on a certain target market, and that was highly successful. Going forward, we'll continue to invest in the brand. So yes, some of that investment will go into brand building and marketing. However, there are also a portion of that, to your point, will be considered more broadly in the investments we're making, whether that's in people or technology, or other areas to continue to grow the company.",neutral,0.2082,0.0089,0.7829
0,Operator,,"Next, we'll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.",neutral,0.0372,0.0194,0.9434
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Just -- Jason, wondering if you can give us an update on your thoughts around fee waivers from here. They came down a little bit. Obviously, rates moved a touch, but not that much. Just any updated thoughts on where you expect those to sit and vis-a-vis waiting for bigger movements in rates going forward?",neutral,0.0919,0.28,0.6281
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Sure. Couple of thoughts. One, even though we saw a little creep this quarter, particularly relative to what we thought. It was actually -- if you think about it, it was driven more by volume. And we -- Mike talked in his opening comments about the fact that money market mutual funds are over $300 billion. That's a record for us. And so -- and I think people sometimes forget that we're participating in the growth, but it also causes higher waivers. And so -- but what's more important is that the overall base of business that we have there is good. And so if you add up the waivers plus what we're earning, and so you think about the overall capacity that we have at the current volume level, it's something like $475 million to $500 million. And that's a strong capacity that we have there. 
Now will volumes stay in as rates go up? Probably -- maybe not. But it's nice that we've had good volume growth there. And the other thing to remember is it doesn't take a big lift in rates for the waivers to come down. And a lot of our AUM there is more institutional pricing. Even our -- even on the wealth side -- even the waivers that are associated in the Wealth Management side -- the nature of our client base means they price themselves more like institutional -- they have got the purchasing power to have more of an institutional approach. And so the fees aren't that high, and it doesn't take that much more yield to clear those hurdles and start to get back to that capacity level. 
And then if you -- the other dynamic is run rate-wise, we're still -- as we sit today, we're still a little over $300 billion that held in over the quarter end. And the run rate on waivers is right at $75 million a quarter.",neutral,0.149,0.0445,0.8064
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Yes. Okay. Great. And then second question, just coming back to the operating leverage point. This year, a bit of like easy comp for market levels, right, driving the huge trust fee growth, and then kind of a harder comp for costs off of last year's really low base. So this year, you've got this really wide gap, but an absolute revenue and an absolute cost growth rate that are both above trend, so to speak. And so I think the reason why the questions keep coming up about cost growth is, next year, when presumably, we don't get as much of that back-end lift from markets alone, what happens with the absolute growth of expenses relative to what might be a slower -- and naturally slower overall revenue growth rate. So how much of this year's 5%, 6% growth rate was also influenced by just the kind of easy comps from last year, so to speak? As it helps to think us about like absolute levels of expense growth next year.",neutral,0.1336,0.1321,0.7343
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"Yes. Just a perspective on that for you, Ken, is I think you're right. I mean we did get a meaningful benefit from the market in the fee growth. And that helps that positive operating fee leverage -- fee operating leverage. The other way that I think about it is what is the absolute level of the expenses to fees. And so now for this quarter, we're at about 102%. That is a much lower level than we've been, and that's evidence of this positive fee operating leverage over time. 
And so at that tight level, to your point, to then say, in the next year, can you continue to drive that down at that same rate? That's why I say it kind of ebbs and flows, right? But we want to be in that range around that 100%, 105% somewhere in there to make sure that we are appropriately investing in the business, et cetera, but also growing. We don't want to squeeze that so much that it impinges on our ability to serve our clients and to grow.",neutral,0.2136,0.0738,0.7126

But there's so many different security types that are actually within the cash and within the securities. And on the cost of cash and securities, there are some areas where we've strategically gone back and forth into and out of. And that's frankly where the change in classification that you see has been driven. 
And so there could be securities that are -- that have a risk return profile that are very similar to one another, one of which would be classified as cash and one would be classified as securities. And that’s strategically where we'll make some of the kind of portfolio decisions of where we want to be playing based on what we're seeing in the marketplace and how we think about the risk return characteristics.

One, sorry if I missed this, but the growth in C&IS investment management up -- linked quarter, up 13% with money market waivers is being flat. What was the main driver of that?",neutral,0.3218,0.1143,0.5638

7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,Yes.,neutral,0.1082,0.0226,0.8692
34,Mark M. Bette,,"So yes, it was a combination of both markets and organic growth. And to Jason's point, we did have with the higher money fund levels, even though waivers go up, that does come with fees with net new fees. And that would have been partly behind that. But if you were going to break it down, I'd say that the new business or organic growth, I would say, drove a little bit more than the market growth did on that sequential growth.",neutral,0.1192,0.0346,0.8462
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Okay. Okay. Perfect. And that actually is a good dovetail into my second question, a little bit broader, but ESG, Asset Management, I think last time I saw that you guys were $155 billion, correct me if I'm wrong on that, on Northern Trust ESG AUM. Maybe just the question, I guess, would be from the organic growth side of your investment management business. 
And as you think of that coming both from the institutional side and then especially on the Wealth Management side, how are you viewing that -- first of all, is it important to your wealth management clients to have this investment management capabilities. And I think, Mike, you mentioned the launch of 6 new products in the quarter. But then also the organic growth potential for Northern Trust investment management from developing those ESG capabilities. Is that going to be a major driver going forward?",neutral,0.0913,0.0165,0.8922
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"So Brian, I would say that that is another major trend. Obviously, that's in the marketplace, but also a big driver for our strategy going forward. Yes, across the company, but as you've highlighted, particularly within Asset Management. And at that $155 billion in AUM now, the growth rate over the last 5 years, there has been about double of what the market growth rate has been for ESG, best we can measure it there. 
And to your point, this hits across our client spectrum. So a lot of that -- it started more outside the U.S. in EMEA, where we initially saw that the greatest growth with institutional clients. But now we're seeing it more through funds and -- in the U.S. and -- with both institutional clients but also with our wealth clients. And we think we're still in the early days. We think that that ESG or sustainability investing will be at a higher growth rate than the rest of the market overall.",neutral,0.2684,0.0138,0.7179

37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"The one I -- thanks for reminding the framework for everyone, but the key element there that has been a driver has been we've been able to see the RWA growth because we've seen the loan growth coming. And that is -- it's a big factor in how things get driven. And there are other things, too, we could see from securities lending and other components of RWA. And at this point, we don't see the same type of RWA lift. 
Now that -- it's not to say that it can't happen. And if it does happen and if we see it, then we'll then look at the other factors and determine where we want to be from a CET1 perspective in other areas. But as we sit today, we don't see the type of organic growth coming in RWA. That's the one component of that overall mosaic I would highlight.",neutral,0.1272,0.0153,0.8575

4,Alexander Blostein,,"So I had a question around the money market fund business. You've had quite a lot of success growing that business in AUM and really gaining share against a large sort of book of inflows that the whole industry have seen. How sticky do you think those assets are going to be in light of tapering, hopefully, near term, but also sort of longer term as we start to contemplate interest rate increases? 
I think we've also gotten accustomed to thinking about, right, deposits will probably start to lead the industry. But how intertwined do you think the money market fund business is with that as we sort of contemplate how much of fee waivers could ultimately come back?",neutral,0.1917,0.0187,0.7896
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"I'll start, Alex, and then Jason, who knows that business well, can give his perspective. But I think what's interesting is coming into the pandemic a couple of years ago, you had a combination of 2 things. One is the obvious, which you're pointing out, which is just significant easing on the part of the central banks, increased liquidity and that absolutely drove the flows into the money market funds is one place. 
But the other dynamic is that was also at a point in time where strategically NTAM was expanding its distribution for money funds. And so not only having a portal, but being on other portals. And so it was an intentional strategy that hit at the right time to essentially capture more a greater share of the increased flows coming from the additional liquidity in the marketplace. So then if you take that and then try to answer your question of what happens to the extent that you have tapering and some contraction there, I think, yes, of course, you're going to see it go down. But I think it's going to be stickier than you might think in the sense of it wasn't just the one factor.",neutral,0.154,0.0431,0.8029
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Got it. Yes, that's helpful because the share gain dynamic definitely helped there. My follow-up is sort of related to that, sorry to go back to the operating leverage dynamic again. But Mike, I appreciate you framing it the way you did is like, look, we're doing 100% to 105% expenses to total fees. That's kind of where we hope to be. As we contemplate fee waivers coming back, should I think of the expenses to fees going below 100%, which I guess would imply almost all of the fee waiver benefit will come through to the bottom line at 100% margin? Or 100% to 105% is kind of what you see yourself living even within normalization and sort of interest rates?",neutral,0.0879,0.0359,0.8762
42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"Yes. So kiddingly, if you could also tell me what equity market levels are going to be at that point in time, that would help as well because -- but you're highlighting the right thing, Alex, that we're benefiting now from strong markets with regard to that ratio, and we're being penalized, if you will, by the money market fund fee waivers. And so that's playing out in there. 
But I would say, more importantly, to your question is, yes, that's going to ebb and flow. But I don't believe that that is a ratio that just continues to grind down below 0 and well below 0, et cetera. Because I think that that would actually -- again, that would impact our ability to have the right talent, make sure that they're compensated appropriately and fairly for all the value that they're delivering to invest in the technology, to take care of our clients, but also to grow the business. 
So simplistically, it would be a draw on the business if you try to squeeze it too tight, so to speak. So that's why my own view is that range is more importantly -- that’s more important. Now that said, that is not the only ratio that drives overall profitability and returns, as you know. And right now, with rates where they are and net interest margin where it is. The other revenues, so to speak, which are a bigger driver in driving the pretax margin are at a lower level than they have been. And so point being, you can be in that range and yet have the other revenues growing in such a way that your profitability is growing up --going up and your returns are going up.",neutral,0.2094,0.2832,0.5074
0,Operator,,We'll take another question. We'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,neutral,0.031,0.025,0.944
16,Vivek Juneja,,"A couple of them. Firstly, balance sheet, given the plans profit tapering, your average deposits have been gradually going up. What do you see as the outlook for that given the tapering thing that I just mentioned? Do you see yourselves being able to continue to grow that?",positive,0.7874,0.028,0.1845
37,Jason Jerrome Tyler,,"Well, I think it's -- it's hard to tell. I think our clients right now see the flat yield curve. And I've been saying -- I think it's less about the very short end of the curve. And in some ways, it has more to do with the shape of the curve. And if there's some lift in the medium, then I think that's more than anything else what might cause clients to move off of the overnight effectively to try and get some yield. Right now with rates flat so far out, there's just no enticement to do anything else. 
Another dynamic is that some clients think about cash as an asset allocation. And we were just talking about the equity markets have done well. And so with markets now where they are and everyone’s seeing their overall portfolio so much stronger, we should also assume clients are going to want to have more allocation to cash. And so I think both of those dynamics need to be played through as we think through. But we certainly think that the things Mike talked about with the money market mutual funds and the strength of our balance sheet are things that do attract clients to think that it's a good place for us to be able to provide liquidity resource for them.",neutral,0.2181,0.0326,0.7493

42,Michael G. O’Grady,,"Yes. I would say that, particularly on the hedge fund administration side of it, some of that has already played through in previous years. And so like it would be similar then to other asset classes. On the private capital side, so PE and infrastructure and real estate and things like that. To your point, it's earlier in the development of that market. More of it, I think, will be outsourced over time. The size of the funds, obviously, are increasing.
