0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,neutral,0.0373,0.0221,0.9406
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"A couple of questions. One on the deposit -- the NIR guidance that you just laid out. I know you gave us a lot of detail around 2Q. And I guess I'm just wondering as we think forward from there, do you anticipate that the deposit competition would slow and then really it's a function of yield curve? Or is there anything that you expect you'd be doing in the balance sheet to shift the trajectory of NIR if this current rate environment held?",neutral,0.0468,0.1948,0.7583
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Betsy, it's Mike. I'll take a shot and Charlie can add if he wants. I think if rates sort of stay where they are, we would expect over time that pricing sort of stabilizes. As I said in my remarks, we haven't quite seen that yet, but we would expect pricing to stabilize as we go. And as we sort of think about the new rate environments and things we can do on the balance sheet, we're doing all the things you would sort of expect us to do as we sort of look to optimize as we look forward both on the funding side and how we sort of manage the securities portfolio primarily.",neutral,0.1518,0.0254,0.8228
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,Okay. Anything on like bringing down other wholesale cost of funds or shifting the liability structure at all that might help out here?,neutral,0.0967,0.016,0.8874
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,Yes. We're looking at all of that. And I think there's things we can do both on our long-term debt that we've got both on tenor and quantum as well as sort of all the funding sources that we're sort of looking at.,neutral,0.1076,0.014,0.8784
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. All right. And then, separate topic on the efficiency improvements that you outlined. Maybe give us a sense as to the quantum of that and kind of the time frame that you think that, that would occur over?",neutral,0.0597,0.0151,0.9252
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Sure. Betsy, it's Charlie. So when we talked last quarter, what we said was we're continuing to significantly increase our investment in technology and we wouldn't expect to see a meaningful change in expenses this year. So obviously embedded in there are a whole series of efficiency improvements that we expect to get throughout the year, and we feel very good about our ability to deliver that. I'll say that we are in the early stages of figuring out kind of what's next, taking it to the next level. We have several new people who've joined us. As I mentioned Lester, who runs over 20,000 of the 50,000 people, and I think we all have -- we all believe that there's continued meaningful opportunity to become more efficient and improve the quality. And so hope -- we would expect there to be more, but not quite sure on the timing yet.",positive,0.5844,0.0126,0.4029
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then just lastly, on -- go ahead.",neutral,0.052,0.0195,0.9285
1,Charles W. Scharf,,All I was going to say is but -- just you can assume that we're pushing as hard as we can.,neutral,0.2065,0.0248,0.7687
5,Betsy Lynn Graseck,,"Okay. And then, just lastly on the announcement that you made with BlackRock regarding the Aladdin functionality that you're enabling your clients to benefit from. Could you give us a sense as to how much you think that is going to help out either on your efficiency or your clients' efficiency? And I know in the press release, you highlighted this was the first of many -- or enhancements that you're anticipating. Maybe you can give us some color on the road map that you're expecting with this strategic alliance?",positive,0.6678,0.0096,0.3227
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes, so I put it into 2 different categories. There's series of things that we've been working with BlackRock for a long period of time on that relate to the processing environment that we have between what Aladdin does and what our capabilities are. And as we have gone through that journey with them -- and by the way, just to be clear, a lot of it is them. So I'm not saying this is just us, we've just taken the efficiency with which we process our transactions to an extraordinarily high level that we haven't seen in many other places. And so that's an opportunity, which benefits us because we've become more efficient, but it obviously benefits the asset managers well because they see efficiencies on their side as just well as quality improvement with the extraordinarily high rates of straight-through processing that we ultimately have. So those are opportunities that common clients have. 
And then, in addition to that, we've introduced a series of analytical capabilities that benefit both operations professionals and investment managers embedded in the Aladdin technology that we think provides further benefits. So I think when we -- as we look at it, it benefits us for sure just, but it also creates additional capabilities for clients that today -- that are available in the marketplace today. This isn't something that we're dreaming of. This isn't an idea that we have. It's there today, and our goal is to continue to expand the integration and to think about other third parties that are important for our clients who are non-Aladdin clients.",neutral,0.3236,0.0121,0.6643

11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Looking for a little more color on the comments around the significant deposit pressure. And we all know it's real and ongoing. But I'm curious on how it manifests itself? How the dialogue happens? And more importantly, if you have metrics around overall client profitability that you can price per client, I'm just looking for a little bit behind the scenes, if I could?",neutral,0.0692,0.0225,0.9083
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Glenn, it's Mike. Sure. So as you know, many -- most of what we do is -- it operates in a pretty competitive marketplace right across lots of strong competitors, both here in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And so our clients are -- and many of our clients are doing business with multiple providers both in the Asset Servicing space and the Treasury Services space. So the price transparency around deposits is there for clients. And so they're very well informed and in dialogue with all of those competitors. And so it happens naturally in sort of the conversations around what am I getting paid on my deposits and here's what so-and-so is sort of offering. So very natural conversations sort of with clients. And that, as I said, that transparency is very much there in the marketplace. Now just keep in mind, as you know, many -- most of our deposits are linked to operational activities, but there is ability for clients to sort of move deposits on the margin to take advantage of where there are differences in what clients are sort of paying. So I think that's the nature of that. What was the second part of the question?",neutral,0.0586,0.0364,0.905
1,Charles W. Scharf,,Our client profitability.,neutral,0.3069,0.014,0.6791
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Oh, client profitability, sorry. Yes, so we do very detailed client profitability for our clients and have a very good sense of what's driving that and can be smart about pricing both deposits as well as sort of the overall relationship in a way that optimizes it by client. So we feel pretty good about that.",positive,0.4951,0.0133,0.4916
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. And I'll just add to it. I think it's a strong discipline that exists not just in how much we make on NII with the client, but it's a relationship view, where we see all the activity that we do at the client across the entire firm. And I think we -- you try and be smart about maximizing profit and returns relative to what the relationship looks like.",neutral,0.1226,0.0149,0.8625
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"I appreciate that. Just one another quick one and we can stay high level, but the notion of nontransparent ETFs obviously is on display with the SEC's recent comment. So the question is from both asset management and Asset Servicing, I would think from an asset management standpoint, and I'm curious on your thoughts on how much of a benefit and how much product design you might have in motion? And on the flip side, is there risk on the Asset Servicing side simply because I think of it generically of -- look these products, if they succeed in the future, succeed because they bring a lower cost and lower-cost investment management fee, lower cost on the servicing side, so how much of an impact is that there for you guys?",neutral,0.0924,0.0213,0.8863
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Glenn, we're looking at that now. As you know, it's not a big piece of the pie now nor do I personally think it will be a big piece anytime soon, but we're sort of -- we're spending some time looking at it now both on the asset management side and Asset Servicing, make sure we understand it fully.",neutral,0.0852,0.0126,0.9022
0,Operator,,We'll next go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.0326,0.0206,0.9468
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Maybe just to go back to the deposit questions to Charlie and Mike. Can you talk a little bit about some of your organic growth initiatives, the progress on the priorities that you highlighted in the presentation in terms of the ability to grow deposits organically and then potentially stabilize the net interest revenue profile and do you think regrow it maybe later in the year or is that longer term?",neutral,0.1138,0.0112,0.875
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes, I think we just, sort of, think about the organic growth initiatives. I mean, Charlie sort of highlighted a bunch of them by business. And as we said, this will take some time to really be meaningful across the -- any of the businesses or sort of in total, but we're seeing good traction in a lot of it. Charlie highlighted the Corporate Trust activity that we're seeing. We're seeing some green shoots in sort of that business as we sort of build out the capabilities. Pershing continues to be strong and getting stronger in terms of the pipeline. Asset management's been doing a good job building out some differentiated strategies like risk parity and a whole bunch of other items that will build over time. We've seen -- also seeing some good performance in some of the key strategies as of today in that business as well. And so I think we feel confident, sort of, in our ability to, sort of, execute on these. But as we've said, it will take some time to see it come into the picture. I think -- do you want to add anything?",positive,0.7658,0.0107,0.2234
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"No. The only thing -- listen, I just -- listen, we're not going to hide behind the facts of the quarter, right? They are what they are. NII is disappointing. That's obviously clear when you look at the results. But when we look at the underlying metrics of the progress that we're making, which is what will drive the long-term performance, within the Asset Servicing business, we feel very good about the pipelines and the types of things that we're seeing. The things that we've announced with BlackRock and other things we're working on are what's going to drive the success in the future both in fees and, ultimately, in our ability to attract deposits, which come with that business. We talked about Pershing extensively, about getting through this -- these couple of losses that we've had, but we've got a lot more coming and which we feel great about the pipeline there. 
Issuer Services, we talked about the share that we're taking or I should say winning back in some respects. In the Corporate Trust business, Treasury Services, we feel very good about the way we're building the business and what the opportunities are there. Clearance and Collateral Management has done extremely well not just because of the conversions from JPMorgan, but just the underlying growth that we've been able to generate there. And Investment Management, we had the outflows last year, but performance is coming back. So I just -- we do have to get to the reality of the interest rate environment, but the things that we're doing to drive growth over a period of time, we don't feel any worse about. And I think on the margin, we feel slightly better, and we're continuing to drive it, but it will take time to show up in the numbers.",neutral,0.3391,0.031,0.6299
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"No, that's super helpful. And then, just -- I'm back to the BlackRock announcement. I think it's 40-or-so clients that -- I think we saw in the press in terms of common clients between BlackRock and Bank of New York. Can you just talk about the timing of the integration of the -- of their services on the 2 platforms? And then the organic growth potential from that combined offering as you look to your other BNY clients that are not using Aladdin right now, but maybe could either switch and sort of how you think about that in the long-term paradigm of integrating the front to the back office given the, sort of, industry shift in that direction?",neutral,0.1117,0.0117,0.8765
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. As I said before, the additional capabilities and the widgets and the apps that we have created to be integrated into Aladdin are available immediately. And our ability to integrate data in a more seamless way to help drive the more efficient operational process, that's available today. So we made the announcement. We're in conversation with the common clients that we have to make sure they understand what the capabilities are. And so we'll see over the next couple of months what the uptick is. Again, we feel very good about the value add that's there. And as I said, we're continuing to -- the capabilities that we announced aren't the end of the road. We're continuing to build new capabilities, which will be integrated. Beyond Aladdin, as I said, we are -- we believe that we should be an open platform. In fact, most asset managers use more than one provider. To the extent they want to use Aladdin, we're obviously there to support them today, but we also want to be where our clients are. And so there are a lot of very strong platforms out there that our clients use. You can assume that we're having lots of discussions and the benefits that we've been able to bring to Aladdin, we would assume we would be able to bring to other providers as well so we can help a much broader set of our clients.",neutral,0.3259,0.0121,0.662
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,neutral,0.0326,0.0297,0.9377
13,Michael Roger Carrier,,"Maybe just a two-part question. You gave a lot of guidance on the net interest income. Just wanted to get sense given the rebound in the markets, can you provide some context on how you see that benefiting some of the fee revenues ahead? And then, have you seen any improvement on the transaction side across some of your businesses like throughout the quarter given the weak start that we saw across the capital markets at the beginning of the quarter?",negative,0.2987,0.4884,0.2129
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"I'll start on the second part first, Mike. I think transaction volumes were pretty muted all quarter. So we didn't see really any big uptick in the second part as we, sort of, came out of the quarter. So it was pretty consistent. And if you recall last year, last year's volumes were very high, particularly in the first half of the first quarter of 2018. So we certainly didn't see -- even as the market rallied in the first quarter, at least, in the U.S., we didn't see that transaction volume, sort of, follow with it. So I think that's the case. I think on just the overall market impact, I think you can see in our disclosures in asset management what the AUM looks like. So that will give you a good sense of how we're entering the quarter by asset class and how to think about that. And then, on the Asset Servicing side, in particular, just if you recall, roughly 2/3 or a little less of our AUC/A is fixed income. And so we get the benefit of the market impact on the rest of -- on other pieces of AUC/A, so you get a sense of how to model that as you go into the second quarter.",neutral,0.1399,0.055,0.8051

15,Adam Quincy Beatty,,"This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just wanted to step back for a sec and talk about EPS growth, you guys had earlier outlined, being able to grow adjusted EPS off the 2018 base. Could you just outline for us what are the key building blocks or drivers of that? And where you expect to have that growth?",neutral,0.0822,0.0127,0.9051
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Well, just to be clear. As we've laid out in here, it's a different environment today than when we made those remarks. And so our ability to fulfill exactly those words is certainly far more challenging. And I'm not sure how to answer the question other than revenues and expenses, right? I mean, we have the pressures that we've seen in NII, which we've laid out. Fees, presumably, will continue to grow both with the net wins that we're seeing in our businesses, the improved flows in asset management and the market levels. And as we've talked about, we're going to continue to be very disciplined on expenses and continue to see what else is available.",positive,0.6249,0.0216,0.3534
15,Adam Quincy Beatty,,"Understood. Then just to hone in on deposits, particularly noninterest-bearing deposits. They were down a fair bit and you talked a bit about that. How much of that do you view as seasonal versus the yield seeking that you identified? And what's the outlook? Do we -- should we expect stabilization from here?",neutral,0.0984,0.3273,0.5743
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"I wouldn't think of the decline as seasonal. I don't know that would be the right way to think about it. And look I think we -- as we said for a while and as I said in my remarks, we would expect those to come down a little bit more in the second quarter, and I wouldn't go any further than that at this point.",negative,0.0326,0.9036,0.0638
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0349,0.0314,0.9337
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So first question, just looking for a little bit more color on an ARB on, sort of, second quarter commentary and specifically as the yield curve has flattened out here, can you help us think through the repricing risk on the fixed side of the securities portfolio, so kind of where are you reinvested today? What sort of rolling on versus what's rolling off? And if the curve kind of stays at its current state, sort of -- what, sort of, the spread pressure we should anticipate over the next coming quarters?",neutral,0.0514,0.0443,0.9044
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Yes. So Alex, it's Mike. So I think what we've said in the past which is still the case, call it 1/3 of the securities portfolio reprices every quarter, roughly 1/3. So that's either maturing securities or floating, that sort of coming into what the current rate -- what the yield curve looks like. So I think you can, sort of, use that as the basis to do your modeling. And then I think as I said for the second quarter, we would expect pricing to inch up a little bit on interest-bearing deposits and so that will give you a sense of how to think about the compression there.",neutral,0.2091,0.0293,0.7616
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Okay. And then on the expense outlook, I don't know if I heard you guys update the guidance there, but I think on the last call, you talked about, sort of, flattish, maybe slightly higher expenses for the year, which I think off of the, call it, $10.9 billion expense piece last year. Obviously, the environment has changed where you guys are doing what you can on that front, saw a nice reduction in the headcount this quarter. But I guess as you look beyond, does the expense guide hold, so kind of flattish expenses for the year? Or should we anticipate slightly lower costs?",positive,0.4302,0.2732,0.2966
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"I think I answered this earlier. I think we are still very comfortable with what we've said, which is we're continuing to significantly increase the investment in technology and offset it with efficiencies that we're getting elsewhere. And so our ability to deliver on that, I think, we still feel very, very good about. We've got some new people in some big jobs here that are continuing to dive in and figure out what comes next. We all feel like we've got a lot more opportunity than we've currently addressed, but not exactly sure what the timing is. So more to come as the year unfolds.",positive,0.7744,0.0127,0.2129
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,neutral,0.0371,0.0353,0.9277
16,Vivek Juneja,,"Charlie, I just wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier. You said the widgets are all ready for the Aladdin to be able to roll that out to other -- to all your clients. But you also talked about developing stuff for the others. Are you already ready with developing products for other providers like Aladdin? Or is that something in process? Where are you in that...",neutral,0.1071,0.0137,0.8793
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes, that's a good question. And so just to be clear, the capabilities that we have in these applications and widgets can be integrated into countless operating environments elsewhere as long as they can accept them. So these weren't built necessarily for one specific environment and so we're going full speed with others.",neutral,0.133,0.0111,0.8559
16,Vivek Juneja,,"Okay. Great. And so is the next step now just, sort of, going out and offering this to your Asset Servicing clients? And is this something you'd get paid for, Charlie, a separate fee? Or does it roll into the overall fee rate? How -- can you walk through, sort of, what it means from a revenue and business standpoint now that you have this and can provide this?",neutral,0.0583,0.0199,0.9218
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. So for the things that we have rolled out now, these are -- they're actually capabilities that existing clients currently have in our Asset Servicing space. And so whatever we get paid for the business we have with them, they have access to those capabilities. What the integration with Aladdin does is, it makes it far, far easier to actually access our capabilities at the same time they're accessing all of the information and capabilities that lead up to the time we get involved in the trade. So just think of the ability to be -- have one screen with your front end on one part of the screen, your back end on the other and being able to answer questions real time effectively on one screen. And so to the extent that we build out additional capabilities just like we would in our typical business, those are things that we might or might not charge for. But what we're doing today is what we're getting paid for. But I would say that there is relatively little uptick -- uptake on the things that we have created because it's hard to use them in concert with the front end and what we've done with Aladdin solves that problem.",neutral,0.0757,0.0242,0.9001
16,Vivek Juneja,,"Okay. Great. Now if we compare this with what State Street did by buying CRD. Do you feel this, sort of, completely fills that without having -- you having to do the acquisition? Or is there more stuff that you need to add or build from a capability standpoint?",neutral,0.0572,0.0192,0.9236
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. Listen, I think we've been very, very clear that we don't believe that owning a front end is necessary or even the right thing, certainly given what our business is. As I said before, many -- most asset managers use multiple providers. Staying at the forefront of building capabilities on the front end is an entire business onto its own that has changed and will continue to change dramatically. That's not our sweet spot. But there are others that do nothing but this that focus on that. And some of them are really good at it. And so what we want to do is make sure that we're working as closely together as we can, not just on integrating capabilities, but working on common data sets and a whole series of things that do make the process much more seamless than it's been. And so that's the journey that we're on, and we think that will be extremely attractive to asset managers and asset owners.",neutral,0.152,0.0129,0.8351

Can you just characterize what you think of the activity that we saw across the businesses in the first quarter?

I think that could change tomorrow depending on, sort of, how investors are, sort of, feeling and the activity levels that are, sort of, coming off the back of that.

Look, I think it's -- I think the way we're going to know it's abating is based on the client dialogue that we're having, right, which is happening every day right across different teams. So we get real-time information about, sort of, what we're seeing in the marketplace. And so I think that will be the best judge as we start to see the dialogues change a bit, but you would expect as -- as we discussed earlier that as -- if rates, sort of, stay here for a while that, that pressure would abate at some point.",neutral,0.1409,0.0511,0.808

Those conversations, where's the money coming from, where is the money going to, at exactly what rates are we paying, what rates are others paying. And I'd just echo what Mike said is, I think as we've gone through a period of change, people have done some different things in the marketplace, but as rates stabilize, you would expect deposit -- the rates that people pay to do the same as well.",neutral,0.0409,0.0806,0.8785

If we see rate cuts, and some of the futures markets is calling that the Fed funds rate will be cut this year, how quickly do you think your deposit betas could fall in that kind of environment?",neutral,0.0776,0.3448,0.5776
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"I think it's -- I mean obviously we'll have to see what's happening at that time, but if rates start to decline, we would expect that we would recapture that pretty quickly.",negative,0.1898,0.6039,0.2063
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.,neutral,0.0348,0.0301,0.9351
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,Quick question on the loans. You mentioned that there was lower client activity driving down the balances in the lending. Can you just maybe highlight or give a little bit more color as to what the client activity was that was decreasing? And is that expected to increase at any point?,negative,0.0351,0.7071,0.2578
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Yes. Look, loans are a really small driver for us as you know from our balance sheet. But just to give you a sense of a little bit of color, we have margin loan activity, our other securities-based lending activity in Pershing as an example. And we saw that come down. We don't think that's a permanent decline, but we saw that come down based on activity in the quarter. That's just an example. But it's a pretty small driver overall for the results.",negative,0.0332,0.9038,0.063
8,Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,,"Okay. And then, sort of, separate question on asset servicing. You mentioned you saw growth in the alternatives. Was that new? Or was it alternative clients new to outsourcing? Or was it just -- were any relationships from clients that were already outsourced?",neutral,0.0783,0.037,0.8847
1,Charles W. Scharf,,"Mixed, both. 
Okay. I think that's the last one. Thanks. We appreciate everyone dialing in. Thanks for the time. We'll talk soon.",neutral,0.1574,0.0228,0.8199
2,Michael P. Santomassimo,,"Thanks, everyone.",neutral,0.2199,0.0354,0.7447
