0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.,neutral,0.0456,0.0217,0.9326
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Thanks for taking away like 17 of my questions with that outlook. That was helpful. I guess a follow-up on the expense question. So if you look at year-on-year, it was up 3%. I heard your guide. It was -- expenses were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. Can we talk about the growth opportunity piece you mentioned? 
What growth opportunities are you investing in? And what kind of payback can we expect? How do you think about that given your huge excess capital? I'm just -- my real question is why not invest more. So that's where I'm going with it.",negative,0.1268,0.5332,0.34
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"It's a great question, Glenn. Thank you. So as you have rightfully pointed out, we have been extraordinarily disciplined on expenses, and we've actually held them flat over the course of the last 4 years. 
Everything that we're talking about here are investments in growth and efficiency. Just to name a few, so certainly, digital assets and all the things we've talked about around digital assets, Data and Analytics, advisory services in Pershing as well as the managed account space. I'd highlight also electronic payment and collection services in Treasury Services. And then the remainder would be modernizing and automating our -- both our risk management and our operations infrastructure. 
And really, as you alluded to, we had a very strong half. We have a very strong capital-generative model. There are interesting opportunities. All of these have been properly vetted and truly will drive incremental growth and efficiency. So we feel now is an important time to invest.",neutral,0.2438,0.0107,0.7455
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Glenn, are you still there? I think we lost you.",neutral,0.0491,0.4728,0.478
11,Glenn Paul Schorr,,"Oh, yes. Sorry about that. I appreciate all that, Emily. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Pershing. 
So in the past, you spoke about some -- maybe some headwinds in the second half. Are you able to quantify that just to give us that heads up on what to expect in the second half? And maybe at the high level, talk about the competitive backdrop there because it seems like some -- yet another competitor is poking their nose and trying to get involved on RIA clearing side.",neutral,0.0927,0.0654,0.8419
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. I can start, and I'm sure Todd can add. Just in terms of the impact of the lost business that we had talked about in the past, it's going to be about $20 million per quarter going forward. And that is, by the way, Glenn, baked into the forecast. So that is embedded in there. 
And yes, it is a competitive space. And actually, that particular piece of business that we're talking about was really we were on the wrong side of some M&A activity. So we do -- although we see a lot of growth and a lot of opportunity, there's certainly further consolidation as well.",neutral,0.2456,0.0695,0.685
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. And I would add that the consolidation that we've seen is actually a positive for us. So we've got a very robust pipeline. We continue to add a significant number of accounts over the course of the quarter and as well as seeing significant growth in funds. And we think there's opportunity to actually invest more. 
So what we did this quarter is we actually separated the businesses into 2. One is the institutional side, where we have some unique capabilities with some very large clients and we've got some pretty good leads there that we're excited about. But also, on the advisory and the broker-dealer side, we think we can invest there and garner some more of what's a very fast-growing industry. 
There is some competition there, but the consolidation has also provided some opportunity for us. So we do get -- every now and then, you get a lumpy loss due to an M&A. We've looked at it over history. That really -- it hasn't changed. We probably won more than we've lost, but we have pointed out that will have an impact in the third quarter.",positive,0.6409,0.0179,0.3413
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.,neutral,0.0407,0.035,0.9243
30,James Francis Mitchell,,Can you speak to your efforts on deposits? It seems like you had some success keeping deposits flat to down. Is that deliberate efforts on your part with less demand for your balance sheet? Maybe you could just speak to the deposit growth in the quarter and how you think about it going forward.,neutral,0.0791,0.0286,0.8923
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. I'll take that. So you're right, we have been proactively managing deposits and very successfully. We've been working with our clients, and you can see that in our trends. So despite the Fed and -- continuing to pump excess liquidity into the system, ultimately, we have managed our deposits and they're down 1% sequentially. This has been very much a coordinated effort with our salespeople and our clients. 
And in terms of looking at what's excess on our balance sheet, we probably think we have about $25 billion to $50 billion that's still excess. But what we have been doing is looking at what is excess and actually working with our clients to move it to off-balance-sheet vehicles such as money market funds. That's partially why you see a 9% growth in our money market fund balances that were driving waivers. 
And we're fortunate, too, in that we have a very robust liquidity solutions business. We offer both in-house as well as third-party solutions, and that has been certainly very attractive to our clients as we've endeavored to manage the balance sheet. And look, going forward, we will continue to do that. It's -- we're comfortable where we are, but certainly, we will continue to do that considering there still will likely be more liquidity coming into the system.",negative,0.3346,0.3537,0.3117
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Jim, it's a very disciplined process that Emily leads along with the salespeople and treasury function. And we look at it client by client. And the good news is we've been able to capture most of that in our money market funds or our Liquidity Direct offerings. 
And so we are gaining market share there. And we've got a little bit of benefit when the Fed did increase the interest rate on excess reserves and the reverse repo. That have made that alternative -- they provided a bit of an outlet. So we think even though the Fed will probably continue to provide liquidity and build their balance sheet, that we should be able to manage it.",positive,0.8605,0.0122,0.1274
30,James Francis Mitchell,,"Right. No, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up to that, if you think -- you've had success on the leverage ratio. When we think about the buyback that you're targeting over the next 18 months, can you front-load that? How do we think about the cadence of buybacks?",neutral,0.1797,0.0118,0.8085
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,Sure. Emily?,neutral,0.0363,0.0469,0.9169
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So certainly, the cadence of buybacks is going to be determined by lots of different factors: our capital position, our forward outlook for earnings, et cetera. But you can definitely assume that considering we have about $2 billion of excess capital now, and that's just against our binding constraint of Tier 1 leverage. Frankly, we have more excess capital when you actually think about what a normalized balance sheet size probably is when some of those excess deposits recede. So assuming -- taking that into account, taking into account the fact that we've also committed to our shareholders that we will return 100% of earnings over time, it's safe to assume that we'll probably front-load that $6 billion of authorization that we've received from the Board.",neutral,0.1391,0.0233,0.8376
0,Operator,,Next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.,neutral,0.0326,0.0507,0.9167
4,Alexander Blostein,,"So maybe just starting with the NIR guide for the back half. It looks like the amount continues to kind of grind lower a little bit, and maybe given what the forward curve has done relative to last quarter, not particularly surprising. But curious if you guys feel like most of the pain is now in the run rate. Is this the right sort of jumping off point to think about as we sort of start to pencil out into 2022?",negative,0.0378,0.7554,0.2068
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So I hesitate to call it trough because every time we do it, it's not accurate. But in terms of just our forward -- our outlook, we just use the forward curve when we project NIR. We don't try to get cute. 
Short-term rates are a bit lower in the forward curve than they were a couple of months ago. Likewise, as you all have seen, the long end has come down and the curve is flattening. And likewise, in terms of prepayment speeds, they have been elevated. And although we do expect them to slow down by the end of the year, they're probably going to still be more elevated than we had originally anticipated. So all of those things are just baked into the 14% down year-on-year.",negative,0.0858,0.777,0.1373
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. A couple of things. I mean one of the key drivers is -- are the short-term rates when you look at LIBOR and obviously, when you look at the Fed funds rate or the IOER. So the fact that, that has stabilized and it stabilized a bit in the forward curve, at least out the next 6 months or so, so the downside drag to that from where we are is probably not likely to be much unless something else were to change. 
And then we're going to have to look at the impact of term rates as we do reprice assets as they come out of the investment portfolio. But our best guess right now is we're pretty close to the trough. And as we think through money market fee waivers, it does feel like the support in the reverse repo program has probably bottomed that out.",neutral,0.1104,0.2275,0.6621
19,Emily Hope Portney,,Yes.,neutral,0.1082,0.0226,0.8692
4,Alexander Blostein,,"Great. That's helpful. I was hoping to dig through a couple of business line items as well. Maybe just focusing on Asset Servicing for a second. 
It seems like the business is seeing pretty decent momentum here. When I sort of back out money market fee waivers from the Asset Servicing line, it looks like it was up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 7% year-over-year, so -- despite obviously moderating industry volumes backdrop. Can you help us bridge maybe what sort of the source of growth here are sequentially? 
And as we're sort of thinking ahead over the next sort of 12 to 18 months, what do you expect to be the bigger contributors to growth here? I know there's a bunch of things that sort of go in there, right? There's the custody and admin business, but then there's also tri-party repo and a couple of other things.",neutral,0.2268,0.0192,0.7539
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. So let me start with the more traditional custody business. I think we are having quite a bit of success there. We've got -- we won a couple of very nice mandates this year. Our sales growth is ahead of where it's been. The ETF business is growing very nicely. We captured -- it's up significantly on a year-over-year basis. Our capabilities there are quite good. 
In our venture with CIBC Mellon, we've actually won 11 of the 16 ETFs that have been listed on the TSC (sic) [ TSX ]. And so we're seeing healthy growth there. We've got about 100 opportunities in our digital asset space, so that is getting some traction. And we've got really good flows across a number of our existing organic flows with our existing clients. So it's a combination of all of that, Alex.",positive,0.9273,0.0105,0.0622
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0371,0.0473,0.9156
6,Brennan Hawken,,"I'd like to start with the balance sheet. You touched on the estimate of excess deposits. That was really helpful. Curious about what drove though, on the funding cost side, the improvement quarter-over-quarter. 
Was there any noise in that? Or do you think that's sustainable? And then when we think about squaring the guide for balances, what are you assuming for deposit growth from here for the rest of the year?",neutral,0.117,0.0291,0.8538
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So just on the funding side, really, there was a benefit of also lower rates there. So that was what was driving it. Nothing else really notable.",neutral,0.171,0.049,0.78
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. A lot of our debt is swapped to floating. So as we saw lower LIBOR, we saw that -- through that as well.",neutral,0.1989,0.0467,0.7543
19,Emily Hope Portney,,Exactly. And then I think the other question was -- what was the second part of the question?,neutral,0.0366,0.1131,0.8503
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,About balance sheet growth.,neutral,0.111,0.0175,0.8715
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Oh, balance sheet growth, yes. We -- similar to what I had alluded to before, we will continue to monitor and proactively manage the balance sheet. We do have room should deposits go up further. But of course, like I said, based on the excess that we have, we'd like to kind of stay where we are and frankly, manage it down further.",positive,0.5386,0.0508,0.4106
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Okay. Got it. And then when we think about servicing -- the servicing revenue, and Alex touched on this a little, what was the contribution of activity this quarter? What was the benefit of new business? 
Was there some -- did that come in late in the quarter from a -- I know we -- it's an imperfect way to model, but the way we all model this, it looks that the fee rate got hit this quarter. So what were some of the dynamics there? And how should we be thinking about that going forward?",neutral,0.0672,0.0914,0.8414
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"I mean if you're talking about like Asset Servicing versus AUC/A, which I think is kind of what you're alluding to, AUC/A was up 8% sequentially. It's about 1 -- 1/3 of that was market and currency driven, and the remainder was really organic growth. So some really good signs of organic growth. 
When you look at that though against asset servicing fees and revenues, like when we think about it, it's generally helpful, rather than look at the 8%, to probably look at the spot -- sorry, rather than look at the spot, to look at the average growth in AUC/A, which was about 5%. And then when you look at the Asset Servicing fee line, it was flat. But ex waivers, it was up 2%. 
And actually, as we've kind of reminded folks in the past, when we look -- asset servicing fees, only 50% or so are truly driven by asset levels. The remainder are driven by account-based fees and transaction fees. So hopefully, that helps.",neutral,0.4477,0.0421,0.5102
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. When you get under it all, if you look at really what is the organic growth rate underneath -- across the businesses, especially in the Investment Services business, when we look at fees only, if you exclude market appreciation or depreciation, the currency impact, waivers and some of the extraordinary volumes that we had in the second quarter of last year due to COVID, that's -- if you net that out and net the fee waivers out, we're seeing probably something like 2% or slightly better than 2% in the core organic growth.",neutral,0.3547,0.0255,0.6198
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,neutral,0.0418,0.0289,0.9294
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Emily, on the fee side, ex waivers, you talked about the improvement on your outlook to plus 7%, 8% from plus 3%. And I'm just wondering how much of that was just a pull-through of the first half, as you mentioned and/or if you are actually more confident in what you're seeing in some of the core businesses, following on the last few questions, about the underlying growth that you are seeing in other fee areas.",positive,0.8136,0.0195,0.167
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So ultimately, the 7% to 8% is fees, ex waiver, growth over the course of -- year-on-year. So if -- you have some of the numbers to do the math. In the first half, we had about 8% growth. In the second half, it will still be very, very healthy but probably closer to 7%.",neutral,0.3446,0.0326,0.6229
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,Okay. All right. So it was more of just how good it's been and then stays is the way to think about it.,neutral,0.0569,0.0527,0.8904
19,Emily Hope Portney,,Exactly.,neutral,0.0505,0.0259,0.9236
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Okay. Got it. And just coming back to the -- you laid out a lot of new product intros. You've been talking about this for a while. I guess the challenge for us is to understand how these product intros turn into revenues and the time frame by which they do convert. 
And you've talked about the organic growth improving directionally over time. But how do -- how quickly can we start to see some of these improvements and new intros really starting to roll into the income statement? And are there other ones that you can give examples of, which -- where they're live and now starting to be meaningful contributors?",neutral,0.1106,0.0131,0.8763
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Sure, Ken. So as we've described in the past, if you looked at our organic growth over the past few years before last year, it was basically flat. And so now we are starting to see -- we're starting to get some traction as we've improved a number of our services, invested in our Data and Analytics capabilities. And we've talked about our digital assets capability. 
So we're already starting to see some benefit in these numbers now that we're seeing an underlying growth rate of more like 2%. We're already starting to see some benefit to things like our custody and ETF servicing business around some of the digital assets. Our investments in the ETF business is starting to come through and show up in the numbers a bit. Some of the longer-term investments that we're looking to make like Pershing, where we're really investing in the platform, we don't expect that to really turn into revenues for as long as 2 years. So it's -- some of these are very -- are longer term, and some of them are coming through as we talk about them. 
On the Treasury Services side, where you see us gaining some market share and we've had pretty healthy organic growth there, the multicurrency sweeps, it's caught a lot of attention when we announced that. We have clients in it today, and we think that will gain some traction over the next year or so. And I would say the same thing with what we're doing with real-time payments and collections. 
So it's -- we've mapped it out. It's kind of all over the board. Some of them are as far as 2 or 3 years out. Some of the investments that we're making in custody, we would expect to have a return maybe a year out. And some of them are starting to bump into and help us generate a positive organic growth rate of the 2% that we're seeing today.",positive,0.5779,0.0186,0.4036
0,Operator,,And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.,neutral,0.044,0.0248,0.9312
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Just want to come back to the AUC/A up to $45 trillion from the $41.7 trillion. You mentioned about 2/3 of that was organic. Can you parse that out a bit between organic from the client base in terms of net inflows at your clients? It seems like $2 trillion is a large number. So I just wanted to sort of understand new business won by BNY Mellon versus the underlying client growth. 
And then, if you can also comment on the demand for cryptocurrency servicing. Obviously, you have the Grayscale mandate, which is great. Are you seeing an increase in that demand in the second quarter versus what -- I know that began to spike up in the first quarter.",positive,0.5663,0.0258,0.4079
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. So Brian, when you look at our flows and the growth on a year-over-year basis, about half of it is flows that would include net new, new business, and it would also include any lost business and any organic flows from existing clients. So hooking on some winners, as they do -- as they generate new funds, that would be new business for us. And then the combination -- a little more than half is market and currency, and the rest of it is coming from the client flows.",neutral,0.0587,0.0203,0.921
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"I'm sorry, I meant on a sequential basis, from $41.7 trillion to $45 trillion.",neutral,0.0594,0.0612,0.8794
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. On a sequential basis, that number is -- it's pretty similar. It's probably...",neutral,0.078,0.027,0.8949
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Actually, a bit more. On the sequential basis, it's about -- more of it is based on net new business than currency and markets than it was year-on-year.",neutral,0.0506,0.0314,0.9181
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. It's about 50-50, not quite. And then you asked a question around demand for Bitcoin services. And what we have mentioned earlier, we have initiated quite a few ETFs in Canada where they can be traded on the TSC (sic) [ SEC ]. So we've got 11 of the 16 ETFs that exist there and there is activity there. 
And Grayscale, which is the largest asset manager of digital currencies, we've teamed up and partnered with them, both to help them with the existing trust and when and if they get approval from the SEC to list the ETFs, they'll take on our TA and other capabilities there as well. So we are seeing some interest. And then we're also seeing some interest in -- on, what I'd say, the high net worth side. So there is some retail interest that we're hearing through some of the Pershing clients as well as other Wealth Management players.",neutral,0.2768,0.0136,0.7096
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"It's worth just adding to that, that we have been mandated on the 6 of the 13 filings that is out there.",neutral,0.0919,0.0228,0.8853
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,For the U.S.,neutral,0.1056,0.0208,0.8736
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Yes, in the U.S. that are in front of the SEC now.",neutral,0.0373,0.0231,0.9396
7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Okay, okay. That's great. And then just a quick follow-up on the assumptions for NIR and the money market fund fee waivers. Just you mentioned trying to move more of those excess deposits into money market funds. Just in the assumptions of the guidance that you gave, are you assuming some of that transfer from those excess deposits in terms of both the fee waivers moving down, which would be good if you were expecting an increase in money market fund balances? 
And then same with the balance sheet side. As we move into year-end, given that guidance, is there an assumption of conversion of deposits to money market fund balances within that guidance?",neutral,0.0806,0.0243,0.8951
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. I'll take both. And I'm sure Todd will chime in. On the waiver side, really we're just using the forward curve, and we're just assuming balances stay flat. 
As we just -- as we talked about a little bit before, the Fed actually taking some action with technical rates and raising the repo rate by -- the reverse repo rate by 5 basis points has been extraordinarily helpful, and that has put a bit of a floor in terms of gross fund yield. And so that is largely what's driving the improvement that we expect in the second quarter from a run rate of about 200 -- what was 250 this quarter to about $225 million. 
So in terms of going forward, of course, as we start to recoup some of that, it's very dependent upon -- obviously, it will be very dependent upon balance levels, but that's going to be some time in the future. From a deposit perspective, we're -- as I mentioned before, we have a material amount of excess still on the balance sheet. We're fine in terms of where we are, but yes, we'd like to manage that down a bit.",positive,0.6242,0.053,0.3227
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"So Brian, what I would add to that is -- so yes, we're projecting that those balances are going to come down a little bit in the number for NIR. And you got to remember, when we had all this excess capital and there was nothing we can do about it. It wasn't particularly in our interest to push those balances away because they did make up -- even though it was modest, they did make a little bit of incremental income but the return on capital was very poor. So now that we have the flexibility to manage our capital base through the new regime, we very much want to be much more efficient with the usage of the balance sheet. 
Now we didn't try to marry that with how much of the balance sheet comes down, how much of that is going to pour -- is going to come into fee waivers. And remember, if we are growing the money market funds, we are waiving a pile of the fees as well. So fee waivers go up a little bit even though there is some net benefit to us from that. We didn't try to solve that in the guidance that we gave you. We just made it simple, but it's not going to be material in -- a material number.",neutral,0.1537,0.1484,0.6978
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.,neutral,0.042,0.0336,0.9243
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"Just wanted to follow up on a couple of the business lines you called out. Particularly noticed that Issuer Services and Treasury Services performed well. You mentioned some of the drivers, particularly the new product in Treasury Services. But wondering how sustainable you think the growth rates seen in this quarter are going forward.",positive,0.8213,0.0125,0.1662
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I think we continue to see -- as we continue to invest in our payments platform and volumes are moving nicely and we're capturing a little bit of market share, as we look out, we think it's sustainable that we can see some decent growth. And we're introducing some new products that are getting some take-up. So our -- the real-time payments for collections is going to be a very interesting product, and we've got a pretty robust pipeline for that. And we look forward to announcing something in the not-too-distant future around opportunities there. 
And so I think the team has done a good job of capturing that high-margin business. I think the sales effort globally has been strong, and I think we're well positioned to be a provider of services around the globe. We've got great relationships, and I think we're benefiting from that. So I think there's a little bit of room for continued growth there. 
When you look at issuer -- when we look at Issuer Services, that includes Corporate Trust as well as the DR business. Corporate Trust, we've made good inroads in the CLO business. Frankly, a few years ago, we lost a little market share. We're capturing that. We've rebuilt our platform there. And then very good growth in kind of the conventional debt servicing. And DRs, they were very much impacted by COVID. And so now that we're seeing some of these global companies paying dividends, again, we're seeing a little more activity there. And so I think there's room to sustain where we are and grow a bit off of it.",positive,0.7725,0.0179,0.2096
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Just 2 quick things I'd add. On the Treasury Services space, it's a very fragmented market. So it's ultimately -- even a little bit of share gain actually moves the needle considerably. And in DR, as Todd alluded to, just the third quarter tends to be seasonally our best quarter. We had a very strong second quarter, again, as Todd alluded to, with the resumption of dividends and certainly issuance activity. So the step up will probably be a little bit less in the third quarter.",positive,0.7552,0.0863,0.1584

17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. Rajiv, we don't disclose the operating margins across the various businesses. And we did benefit in that margin, obviously, from the reserve release because a lot of that is related to it, but we did see a little bit of underlying margin improvement.
