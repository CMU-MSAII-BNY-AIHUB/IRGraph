0,Operator,,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,neutral,0.042,0.0264,0.9316
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"Wanted to start things off with just a question on the NIR guidance, Emily, that you just gave. I was hoping just to unpack the guide for 4Q, specifically what you're assuming in terms of deposit and balance sheet growth; liquidity redeployment; and I guess, last and certainly not least, premium amortization.",neutral,0.0454,0.0266,0.9279
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So just -- why don't we first just start with the third quarter. In the third quarter, NIR was down very, very modestly. That was off the back of lower reinvestment yields, also lower interest-earning assets as we worked with our clients to actually manage especially excess deposits. We were able to offset that with some tweaks in the securities portfolio. And also, we did see a benefit from premium amortization coming down that was both a mixture of us reducing the size of our MBS portfolio as well as the fact that prepayment speeds did slow down quarter-to-quarter. 
Our full year guide, as you just rightfully pointed out, remains at down 14% for the full year. In terms of kind of what's baked into the fourth quarter, look, I think we have more or less hit the trough. What's baked in there, certainly, we'll still have the impact of lower reinvestment yields as a headwind. We are expecting a further reduction in interest-earning assets because we will continue to work with our clients in terms of managing excess deposits. So perhaps we expected them to go down by about $5 billion to $10 billion. 
With respect to premium amortization, it's likely our expectation or forecast based on rates is that it will be pretty much flat fourth quarter to third quarter. And look, there's probably some upside. I mean certainly, based on what we're seeing in terms of volatility in rates and even some movements by, for example, the Bank of England, et cetera, so there could be some upside.",negative,0.0254,0.9367,0.0379
27,Steven Joseph Chubak,,"That's great color, Emily. And just for -- a follow-up on expenses. I was hoping you could speak to the expense growth outlook. We've seen a number of upward revisions to the expense guidance over the course of the year. And just wanted to gauge whether the current level of expense, it's about $2.85 billion ex the litigation cost, is the right jumping-off point for 4Q and maybe just longer term, what level of expense inflation we should be underwriting on a more normal basis just given the continued investments you cited in the business.",neutral,0.149,0.025,0.8259
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So within the quarter -- so yes, expenses overall up 6%. We're still guiding for the full year expenses to be up 5% versus last year, obviously ex notables. When you unpack the third quarter, about 2/3 of that is attributable to what we call revenue-related expenses, inclusive of an uptick in higher incentives. We obviously want to pay our people competitively and for the strong organic growth that we are seeing. About 1/3 of that is split evenly between the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar as well as the incremental investments that we have pulled forward. 
So those are the investments in both -- in growth, in infrastructure as well as efficiency. We're also -- it's worth mentioning that in the third quarter, we are starting to see an impact of a tighter labor market, both in terms of competition and in terms of costs. And also, in the third quarter, there was an impact of a merit increase which took effect in June. 
As we kind of look out, it's certainly too early to really comment on 2022. We're in the middle of the planning process. What I would say is that yes, the uptick you're seeing in the second half of the year is really the jumping-off point for next year, and ultimately, there are other headwinds as well; inflation, as I just mentioned. 
Look, we're seeing, it's a good thing, but return to more normalized travel rates. So T&E is likely to go up. We're -- as we reopen the offices and return to the office, there'll be some additional expenses associated with that. Of course, we will continue to also achieve and identify efficiencies. We're working through the investment spend as we speak, going through the proverbial food fight because, as always, there's lots that we want to do. 
But what I would say is we are intensely focused on expense management. We will continue to be focused on expense management, but we're also going to invest through the cycle. And if I were to just give some color, I would just say that expenses in 2022, as I'm standing here today, will be modestly up from 2021.",positive,0.8065,0.0318,0.1617
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,neutral,0.0311,0.036,0.9329
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"Well, this is good timing because I wanted to follow up on the food fight, investment spend discussion. So software costs were up 8% year-over-year. And Todd, you started off talking about some fintech-like initiatives. And so I'm just wondering if maybe next year, you want to spend more money. I mean there's this tough trade-off that you have in delivering results and investing for what you think could be a good effort. 
I didn't fully understand when you're talking about Pershing and the transaction banking payments. So maybe if you could just describe the total addressable market for that, how much you have and where you think you're getting or some color around that and then what type of spending that's going to involve.",neutral,0.0937,0.0247,0.8816
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. So Pershing X is, I think, an exciting opportunity for us. And so if you think about the registered investment adviser business, so if you think about Pershing, we're really the largest correspondent clearer. So we're a third-party clearer for broker-dealers in the retail space and now registered investment adviser. And that business is actually growing, but it's not growing nearly as fast as the advisory space is growing. 
And so we are the custodian. We are the clearer. We are providing a lot of the back-end services for that business. But we think there's the opportunity for us to be an integrator in that business. So -- and it's been growing. I haven't looked at the numbers recently, but it's been growing in the ballpark of 15%. So we think that -- and we've got a relatively small market share for it -- of it, Mike. So we think there's an opportunity for us to pick up market share in a fast-growing segment. So that's why it's so exciting to us. 
In terms of the challenge that Pershing X will solve, if you think about it, advisers have these multiple technology tools, a bunch of different data sets that they're trying to integrate or trying to look at. Oftentimes, they're logging into multiple systems and they're really reducing the advisory productivity. And that would be across things like financial planning, investment modeling, even some banking activities. And we have the ability to integrate our own private bank. 
So there's really no solution out there today that can tie that all together. And so that's what we mean. It will be an open architected but an end-to-end solution. So we'll be integrating best-in-class services amongst some of our own, and it will provide a digital capability and real good retail experience both to the adviser as well as to the investor itself. So that's our target for Pershing. 
I think your other question was around the e-payments. So in e-payments, this is using The Clearinghouse's Real-Time Payment system, and we were the first to actually connect. And now this is a request for payment from a client -- excuse me, our client, so Verizon, to their customer. And they send -- it will come across your -- they'll come across your phone that your bill is ready. Here is your bill, press this and make the payment in real time or you can even -- you can set a time when you want to make that payment to make sure that you've got funds in your account. 
That will connect -- as more and more banks connect to the real-time payment system, that broadens the capability of covering a very large percentage of the market. Currently, there are about 15 billion payments made in the U.S., so it's an enormous market. We've got some -- we've got about 100 prospects showing significant interest in the capability we designed.",neutral,0.1001,0.0204,0.8794
18,Michael Lawrence Mayo,,"Okay. So e-payments, big initiative, big opportunity. Pershing X, if I heard you correctly, big market, big opportunity. So in terms of funding these initiatives, as far as investing in these areas specifically or more generally, I know you've done a lot of overhaul in the back office, a lot of overhaul with your tech talent. What sort of spending will this take? And should you be going faster or slower? Or how do you decide that?",neutral,0.0836,0.0166,0.8998
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I mean we -- so as you know, we've been increasing our tech spend over the past few years. A lot of that, as you pointed out, was in infrastructure and resiliency and building a sounder infrastructure to support the growth that we're looking to drive today. And so kind of the peace dividend from that, we are reinvesting in a number of the -- in software and the app dev that we've talked about. 
So I kind of categorize it into 3 areas. One is we've talked about our initiatives. I mean we just talked on 2, Pershing and treasury, but we've got some very neat things going on in our Data & Analytics capability. We're digitizing things across the bank. The wealth platform, we continue to invest in for our own Wealth Management activity. Corporate Trust, we're using smart contracts and developing a digital network for our clients to operate on. In Investment Management, we're -- so just about across our businesses, we continue to invest in technology. 
There's also ongoing infrastructure and risk management. I mean our cyber defenses are not cheap, and we need to continue to invest in them. We're doing a significant number of cloud conversions, as I think through it, across the company. Regulatory reporting requirements continue to go up. There's a lot of liquidity requirements as well as complying with the LIBOR requirements. And we will always be focused on data and resiliency. 
And then on the efficiency side, there's -- we've actually inventoried the number of things that we do manually, and we're looking to knock them out for automating when it can create some significant efficiencies and risk reduction. And we're also looking to modernize some of our core apps. So even on our Treasury Services, we're putting very modern payments app -- engine underneath all of this. So there are a lot of -- the good news is there are a lot of opportunities, but it will come with some costs. And our intent is to increase our technology spend next year.",neutral,0.2404,0.0146,0.745
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,neutral,0.0309,0.0291,0.94
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Todd, can you -- or Emily, when I go back to the year-end 2019 pre-pandemic size of your balance sheet, you guys had assets about $382 billion and deposits of $259 billion, let's call it. And then you had deposits at the Fed of $95 billion. Obviously, today, it's considerably higher. 
When the Fed finishes quantitative easing, assuming it's finished by next summer, can you kind of frame out for us what you think your balance sheet might look like as we go forward? Are customers going to be pulling deposits out? Do you think it will shrink down? Not that you'll ever get to that year-end '19 level, but should we start to think about a continued falling on the size of the balance sheet?",negative,0.068,0.4976,0.4344
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"So I'm happy to take that, and Todd certainly can chime in. So the way we think about deposit levels now, we probably still have around 10% to 15% of our deposits are excess, and they will eventually recede in a more normalized rate environment. But actually, core deposits overall are also up just given the growth in AUC/A, et cetera. So I mean the core deposits are also up, but the excess is about 10% to 15%. And the way we've been looking at it is certainly we've been kind of managing the growth in those deposits very successfully, so kind of very -- in a targeted way, looking at what we deem to be excess and working with our clients to pursue off-balance-sheet alternatives for those particular balances. 
And as the Fed begins to taper, and we all think they will begin to taper soon, I think that does help in terms of kind of putting a lid to a degree on the growth of deposits from here. In terms of kind of what we expect kind of in -- I guess, kind of 2023 and beyond, yes, I think at the stage where the Fed actually hikes on multiple occasions, it's kind of only at that point that we would probably see a decline in deposits. But the core itself is higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2019.",positive,0.4713,0.1939,0.3349
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"And Gerard, I think if my memory serves me right, that date was -- you were picking an end date. It was actually -- the averages were a little bit lower than that. So there is a significant amount of excess. It will start to -- and that's why we're sitting on so much cash at central banks. And we'll probably see a little less pressure certainly for deposit growth when the Fed starts to taper. But to Emily's point, the excess coming off is probably sometime thereafter.",neutral,0.0784,0.4355,0.4862
10,Gerard Sean Cassidy,,"Correct, Todd. They were period-end numbers. Good memory. 
The follow-up question, you guys had a very robust share repurchase amount this quarter, as Emily pointed out, of $2 billion, and there's guidance for the fourth quarter. The question is -- if I recall correctly, you have a $6 billion program that I think expires at the end of next year. If you reach the $6 billion prior to the termination date, would you consider re-upping -- assuming, of course, your capital ratios permitted, would you consider re-upping the buyback if you use it all up before that termination date?",neutral,0.1305,0.0498,0.8197
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"The answer -- Gerard, if you think about it, the stress capital buffer regime has actually made things a little more flexible for us. And so certainly, the Board recognizes that if we continue to produce the capital that we're likely to and we buy back the excess capital that we've accumulated, we'll be in a position to come back to them and ask for more. So the answer is yes.",positive,0.5174,0.02,0.4625
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.,neutral,0.0349,0.0297,0.9354
32,James Francis Mitchell,,"Maybe just one on issuer service fees. They were flat sequentially. And typically, you'd have some seasonality. I think you mentioned some weakness in -- on the corporate side -- Corporate Trust side. Is that just pushed out? Should we expect some rebound in 4Q? Just how do we think about the trajectory in that business? And any more detail on the quarter would be great.",neutral,0.144,0.0743,0.7817
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. So in the Issuer Services, you really do have 2 businesses: Depositary Receipts and Corporate Trust, as you point out. Within DR, we definitely saw a resumption in both issuance and dividend activity, and that was really even on top of the normal uptick that we see in the third quarter. 
In Corporate Trust, the underlying business actually is performing really well. Volumes in structured products are up actually meaningfully, slightly offsetting a small decline in activity in munis. But the third quarter for Corporate Trust, there were really 2 things that also impacted revenue. 
So one was a decline in reimbursable expenses. We've got reimbursable expenses that are just a pass-through. And ultimately, so that impacts revenue, does not have any impact whatsoever on PTI. And also, there was a discontinuation of a public sector mandate that started in this quarter, and you'll -- we'll see the full effect of that in the next -- in the fourth quarter, will probably be another $10 million or so decline.",negative,0.0719,0.8755,0.0526
32,James Francis Mitchell,,Okay. And -- but no -- nothing got pushed into 4Q? It just was those issues.,neutral,0.0373,0.1383,0.8244
19,Emily Hope Portney,,Yes.,neutral,0.1082,0.0226,0.8692
32,James Francis Mitchell,,"Okay. And just maybe on the payments business. I think it's kind of an interesting push. You've already had some growth in Treasury Services. So maybe you could just talk a little bit of what's been driving the accelerating growth of late. I think it's a little too early to be expecting anything from these new initiatives. 
And then I guess, as we think about the new initiatives, like this Verizon deal and others potentially, is that a first-mover advantage type thing? I guess how do you defend being the intermediary between the merchants and the banks? Is it just simply being the first-mover advantage? And what do you think the possibility from a revenue standpoint could be from that business?",neutral,0.0686,0.0251,0.9063
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Yes. I mean this is -- so a couple of things there. So effectively, what we're doing is we're digitizing the collection experience. So we've been in the lockbox business, and now we're converting that to electronic for these requests for payments. And it is faster and cheaper for the provider, so the cost actually -- for the utility in this case. So the cost to them on a per-unit basis is down dramatically, and you also reduce float and other items. So we think it's hugely to their advantage. 
So we happen to have the collection relationship. And we can continue this -- paper is not going away. That's going to be a component of it. So we can provide the complete solution, so we just thought we happen to be in a very nice position to do this. And we're not in the card or retail payments business to speak of in between it. So we happen to be very well positioned, and we got a little bit of a first-mover advantage by being into The Clearinghouse's Real-Time Payments system right away. 
In terms of how big can this grow, it could possibly move the needle a little bit and add a little something to our organic growth. I think it's a little too early to tell. We're excited about the relationship that we've got with Verizon. We're excited that this certainly stirred up a lot of interest. And we've got a pretty reasonable pipeline, but I just prefer at this point not to speculate on what that could be right now.",neutral,0.3138,0.0576,0.6286
0,Operator,,Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.,neutral,0.0311,0.0338,0.9351
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Would like to explore the really robust core fee revenue growth that you guys have seen here. Todd, you made reference to a nearly 3% organic growth rate in the quarter, which is really quite good. So is it possible to break down the year-to-date or your expectations for 2021 into different components, how much of it came, you think, from organic, how much activity and volume related? 
I seem to recall that in the past, you've said that half of your servicing business is market-sensitive. So is that still the right way to calibrate when we think about the market impact or pricing dynamics? Is it possible to give some color around the composition?",neutral,0.0807,0.0204,0.8989
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Sure. Sure, Brennan. So I think first of all, we should probably help you understand what we're describing as organic. So we do try to take the market impact out for interest rates and the equity markets. We also try to adjust, for example, for some of the unusual activity that came -- for example, right now, money market funds are very large because of all this excess cash. Deposits are very large because of this excess cash. So we're trying to knock that growth out of the calculation. 
And when we get -- when we knock all of that out, you look at us growing -- our revenue growth minus fee waivers is significantly higher than what we're talking about in terms of our organic growth because that's getting the benefit of some of the market considerations. So our -- once you knock all of that out, the numbers get to something like 2.5% or so for this year, which is much stronger than what we've seen in years past. And frankly, 3 years ago, it was probably 0, maybe even slightly negative. 
Emily, you want to kind of march through some of the areas where we're actually seeing it?",neutral,0.1583,0.0445,0.7972
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"In organic -- sure. I mean the -- and just to really break it down very clearly. So the 11% in fee growth ex waivers we saw this quarter year-on-year, 3% was organic growth, as Todd alluded to. About 6% of that was just market -- was market impact, and the remainder was just impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. 
In terms of the organic growth in that 3%, it was really broad-based. So when you look at Pershing, I think we talked a bit about continued growth in clearing accounts, mutual fund balances and net new assets. In terms of Treasury Services, we saw good growth in terms of payment activity and on the back of both stronger economic -- a stronger macroeconomic backdrop but also net new business. And also, within Treasury Services, we've really shifted the product mix to be higher margin in that business. 
In Asset Servicing, wins are up 40% year-to-date versus what they were last year. So that, too, is just speaking to the organic growth in that business. In FX, volumes were up significantly. And some of that's market, but a lot of that, too, is just based on investments in the FX platform that we've made. So it's really broad-based and strong.",positive,0.7375,0.0222,0.2403
6,Brennan Hawken,,"Excellent. And Emily, I'd like to explore some of your -- I know it's very early to talk about 2022, but the expectation around expenses next year, a few questions on that. Would that modest growth be on a constant-currency basis? 
And when we calibrate -- I think you also had said that the back half of '21 is a decent base in which to build off of. Is that excluding the litigation that you guys had? And if so, could you size that for us? And when we think about modest, is there any way to calibrate that? Like would you consider the 2021 expense growth to be modest? Or is it a bit more significant than that?",neutral,0.0748,0.0193,0.9058
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"So in terms of -- it's a bit early to really comment on 2022. We're obviously going through the entire planning process as we speak. As I did mention earlier, the uplift in expenses that you're seeing in the second half of this year on the back of the investments that we are making is structural, so that -- those are permanent and that really will be baked into next year. 
As I also mentioned, there are some headwinds. We're starting to see a bit of inflationary pressure. Like I said, we're going to return to more kind of normalized, we think, travel, and so T&E will likely go up; a bit of extra expense associated with return to the office. So there are headwinds that of course, we're going to be looking to offset with efficiencies. So I wouldn't want to put an actual number on it, but at this moment, I would say expenses for the full year next year will be modestly up. And that's just on a top line basis. They will be modestly up versus this year.",positive,0.6851,0.2372,0.0777

12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,I wanted to start by just asking you to talk a little bit more about Asset Servicing. It had really good underlying growth if we just keep lending aside and fee waivers aside. And the deck mentions transaction activity and higher market levels. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand. Like how did the collateral business act versus how did the core Asset Servicing act? And what type of net new wins quarter did you see on both sides?,neutral,0.1129,0.0233,0.8637
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"So Emily, why don't I take the clearing and collateral management business, and you can take the rest of the Asset Servicing space. So we saw good growth in the clearing and collateral management business as we have for a while now. In fact, one of the points I made in my remarks, for the first time, we saw the collateral management numbers -- our tri-party numbers exceed $5 trillion in the quarter. So we continue to see good growth there. And the profitability on the global collateral management continues to be strong. We've got innovation that is paying off there. So that attributed a bit to the growth. 
The other thing that we're doing, and we do this out of our Markets business but it's really a collateral management business, is the requirement to meet margining in over the counter -- for over-the-counter derivatives transactions to meet margin requirements. And we're in phase 5 of 6 of that. And our teams did an excellent job of seamlessly onboarding a significant number of players. And that's starting to add a little bit of revenue to the line there. So overall, that business continues to look pretty healthy and continues to show underlying organic growth. 
Why don't you comment on the rest of Asset Servicing?",positive,0.8346,0.013,0.1524
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. As you think about Asset Servicing and just thinking about just the growth in our fees or asset -- sorry, our AUC, our assets under custody, they are up about 17% year-on-year on a spot basis. About half of that was driven by market and the other half truly driven by growth. So both from -- growth from existing clients as well as new clients probably split about 50-50. 
And when just thinking through kind of where we're seeing a lot of that growth, about 30% of it is from investment managers. Another 30% or so is from broker-dealers and banks. And then the remainder is really split between both the alternatives space and the asset owner space. So that's -- we're seeing a nice uptick, and the pipeline is stronger than it was at this period last year.",positive,0.5394,0.0316,0.429
12,Kenneth Michael Usdin,,"Great. And my follow-up is just coming back on the clearing business. Last quarter, you had said that you had expected about a $20 million impact from the deconsolidation that you discussed.

19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Sure. In Pershing, the -- we had originally expected about a $20 million impact of the lost business due to just being on the wrong side of M&A. That is -- due to timing, that was a lot less. So I would think about it as the uptick will be about $15 million. Between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we'll see the full impact.",neutral,0.1031,0.3338,0.5631

7,Brian Bertram Bedell,,"Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe just to follow on, on a couple. So just going back on to the organic growth. Obviously, this is really tracking well, going from 0-ish to now close to 3%. So maybe just a thought. I know 2022 is too early, but given these initiatives that you have and how you think about the revenue following through, do you -- are you optimistic that you can continue to improve upon that 3% number? 
And then just one on Pershing X. Just in that aggregator system, does that require you to disintermediate the current custodians? Or are you becoming the custodian in that process? Or rather, would you sit on top of the current custodian and make it -- have a seamless aggregation of their technology services?",neutral,0.0925,0.0153,0.8922
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"Okay. So why don't I take the Pershing question, and then, Emily, I think you can probably handle the other one. But the Pershing Project X will be multi-custodial, so it will actually be custodian-agnostic. Of course, we'd love to have a custodial business, but we'll be able to provide these capabilities regardless of who the custodian is. And we're working on that capability right now. 
And I must -- I have to say this is going to -- Pershing, in particular, is probably the longest in term of our investments. So this, we're really investing for the future.

19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Yes. I mean if you do the math, it would imply a very -- a slight downtick, about 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter. But of course, rates are moving all the time. Like I said, we're seeing potential upside from some central banks even moving earlier than originally thought. So that's what -- based on the last forecast, it's slightly down, but we think there's potentially some upside. And hopefully, it will be flat.",negative,0.0914,0.8091,0.0996

17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,The competitive wins versus greenfield.,positive,0.9041,0.012,0.084
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"So when -- I mean, certainly, when we look at the entirety of our wins, we're -- both new -- wins of what we call new business, it can be new business from completely new clients as well as new business from existing clients. So as clients obviously launch new funds, et cetera, that's still new business but it's new business with existing clients. And of course, we're always very, very focused on retention. So having the business already and still competitive -- it's competitive out there, so making sure that we're retaining those deals that we already -- that we -- where we are the incumbent. When you look at it, about -- it's about 50-50 in terms of the breakdown of like new versus just retention of existing business.",neutral,0.0776,0.0228,0.8996
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,"And we're -- I think, to your point, we're definitely winning against the competition in a couple of the ones that I even called out today. One in the alternatives space, that was a different service provider. We had a broader set of capabilities in addition to the ability to do the administration, so we've won that business. We won a couple of large businesses over the last -- takeaways over the last couple of quarters. 
So occasionally, we lose them. But right now, our win-loss ratio versus the competition is leaning toward our side. And we think that's because of the capabilities that we've got as well as the quality of the service that we've been delivering.",positive,0.5597,0.0179,0.4225
22,Robert Henry Wildhack,,"Okay. And just to stay on retention, how has the retention rate been trending? And then what kind of opportunities or things can you do to continue to improve the retention rate?",neutral,0.186,0.0199,0.7942
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Our retention rates have been trending upwards and -- we don't really disclose, but certainly, they're trending upward and they're very high, so well in excess of 70%, 75%. So in terms of how, I mean, the first thing I would say is -- first and foremost is just client service and basically performing well day in and day out. And that's what kind of gives you the even -- the right actually to bid and to ultimately retain. So we're intensely focused on that. 
And then, of course, it's about talking to our clients, understanding their strategy. More and more, we're really working in a consultative manner with our clients, looking at their issues, their challenges and how we can bring the solutions of our -- the entirety of the firm to bear to help them with their operating model and to get more efficient and to create alpha. So it's both just being good at the day-to-day and also ensuring that our capabilities and our -- both our capabilities and our products are not only competitive but leading edge and then working with the client -- working with our clients on a very -- in a consultative and in a strategic manner.",neutral,0.1699,0.014,0.8161

25,Michael C. Brown,,"I'm not sure if you guys gave this, but Emily, just given most of your comments are on a year-over-year basis, I was just curious given the move in the dollar and the strengthening that we recently saw. What was the sequential impact to revenues and expenses in the third quarter versus the second quarter from the move in the dollar?",neutral,0.1329,0.1158,0.7513
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Oh, gosh. Off the top of my head, I can't really -- I don't have it off the top of my head. But I mean the good news is that actually we're pretty equally matched. So any benefit you have in revenues or any -- sorry, any headwinds you have in expenses is pretty much equally offset in revenues. From a -- so from a PTI perspective, we're incredibly well hedged.",positive,0.5884,0.0176,0.3941
17,Thomas P. Gibbons,,But it's going to be in the ballpark of 1% to 2% of the expense base (sic) [ year-over-year ].,neutral,0.0668,0.0126,0.9206
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"Yes. Off the expense base, yes.",neutral,0.1437,0.0668,0.7895
25,Michael C. Brown,,"Okay. And then just on the loan book, it's up 14% year-over-year, the average loans, but just 1% sequentially. And that's the lowest growth rate we've seen in the last 3 quarters. Any particular reason there was a bit of a slowdown this quarter? And what's the expectation there going forward?",negative,0.0414,0.7888,0.1698
19,Emily Hope Portney,,"So I mean just to point out, our loan book has grown by 14% year-on-year. So there's been very healthy growth in the loan portfolio over time. Of course, growth in any 1 quarter can be lumpy. We did see some healthy growth. Loans on a spot basis, they're actually up more than -- they're up at -- to $64 billion. 
Some of the growth we're seeing is a growth in margin loans, growth in collateralized lending in Wealth. We're seeing growth in our term loans in terms of securities financing and also more demand in terms of capital call facilities. So -- and look, we do think we have certainly -- we're proactively looking to grow the loan portfolio. And we're very -- we feel that it's certainly an area that's in focus, and we've got capacity certainly to do so.",positive,0.9113,0.0142,0.0745
