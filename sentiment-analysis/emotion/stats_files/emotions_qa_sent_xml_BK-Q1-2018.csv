"So I noticed in the prepared remarks, in disclosure, you noted net interest revenue growth in every single business, obviously, rates were up, but it's also balanced growth. So we noted high deposit betas. I'm assuming that's going to stay given your mix of clients and business. So the question I have is, how much balance sheet growth is possible as you continue to have like really good capital return? Because that's what's -- that's going to help continuing to drive net interest revenue, right?","['notic', 'prepar', 'remark', 'disclosur', 'note', 'net', 'interest', 'revenu', 'growth', 'everi', 'singl', 'busi', 'obvious', 'rate', 'also', 'balanc', 'growth', 'note', 'high', 'deposit', 'beta', ""'m"", 'assum', 'go', 'stay', 'given', 'mix', 'client', 'busi', 'question', 'much', 'balanc', 'sheet', 'growth', 'possibl', 'continu', 'like', 'realli', 'good', 'capit', 'return', '?', 'go', 'help', 'continu', 'drive', 'net', 'interest', 'revenu', 'right', '?']","Confidence, Excitement, Optimism, Positive Surprise","Confidence, Optimism, Doubtful, Curiosity, Skepticism",positive,0.8229,0.0162,0.1609,"Confidence, Excitement, Optimism, Positive Surprise"
"Yes, Glenn, it's Mike. Let me just give you a couple thoughts there, and then, hopefully, I'll answer the question. But as you sort of think about the first quarter, and we said this at Investor Day as well, so -- we saw deposit balances a little higher than we expected in the beginning part of the -- our first quarter and this has come back down to kind of where we expected them to be. And as we sort of think about the second quarter, all things considered, we still expect NIM to increase, and we would expect that even with the lower deposit balances, the rate of growth of NIR will be a little lower than the first quarter, but we still expect to be -- it to be pretty healthy versus the second quarter of 2017. So we still expect to see both of that happening. And I think as we build -- as we continue to build the franchise and bring on new clients, we would hope that our -- any of the decline we see in our balances as a result of rates rising would be more than offset or offset partially at least by new business coming in, and we have the room on the balance sheet to continue to do that.","['ye', 'glenn', 'mike', 'let', 'give', 'coupl', 'thought', 'hope', 'answer', 'question', 'sort', 'think', 'first', 'quarter', 'said', 'investor', 'day', 'well', 'saw', 'deposit', 'balanc', 'littl', 'higher', 'expect', 'begin', 'part', 'first', 'quarter', 'come', 'back', 'kind', 'expect', 'sort', 'think', 'second', 'quarter', 'thing', 'consid', 'still', 'expect', 'nim', 'increas', 'would', 'expect', 'even', 'lower', 'deposit', 'balanc', 'rate', 'growth', 'nir', 'littl', 'lower', 'first', 'quarter', 'still', 'expect', 'pretti', 'healthi', 'versu', 'second', 'quarter', '2017', 'still', 'expect', 'see', 'happen', 'think', 'build', 'continu', 'build', 'franchis', 'bring', 'new', 'client', 'would', 'hope', 'declin', 'see', 'balanc', 'result', 'rate', 'rise', 'would', 'offset', 'offset', 'partial', 'least', 'new', 'busi', 'come', 'room', 'balanc', 'sheet', 'continu']","Confidence, Excitement, Optimism, Positive Surprise","Confidence, Optimism, Doubtful, Negative Surprise, Curiosity, Skepticism",positive,0.8771,0.0608,0.062,"Confidence, Excitement, Optimism, Positive Surprise"

"Yes. I think, obviously, if I'm -- I presume everyone understands what Zelle is, which is the group that is owned by a series of banks that are building out the capabilities to leverage a real-time payments network. In order to participate in those capabilities, the institutions have to do a fair amount of work to integrate their technologies with those platforms. Not every bank wants to do that. Not every bank actually controls their own capabilities because some of it's outsourced. We -- those -- many of those banks are clients of ours in our Treasury Services business. So we have the ability to step in and provide a series of those services to help them get access to those networks. The real question over a period of time relative to what those capabilities mean is, will banks and others build out solutions that access the capabilities of these real-time networks so that product offerings become more attractive versus using ACH and other methods of payment today. That's something we and other financial institutions are very focused on. That will take -- that's not weeks or months, that'll evolve over the next couple of years, but those capabilities are better than what exists in the marketplace. And we're -- think of us as a facilitator for the financial institutions that don't have the infrastructure or can't spend on it to do their own direct integrations.","['ye', 'think', 'obvious', ""'m"", 'presum', 'everyon', 'understand', 'zell', 'group', 'own', 'seri', 'bank', 'build', 'capabl', 'leverag', 'real-tim', 'payment', 'network', 'order', 'particip', 'capabl', 'institut', 'fair', 'amount', 'work', 'integr', 'technolog', 'platform', 'everi', 'bank', 'want', 'everi', 'bank', 'actual', 'control', 'capabl', 'outsourc', 'mani', 'bank', 'client', 'treasuri', 'servic', 'busi', 'abil', 'step', 'provid', 'seri', 'servic', 'help', 'get', 'access', 'network', 'real', 'question', 'period', 'time', 'rel', 'capabl', 'mean', 'bank', 'other', 'build', 'solut', 'access', 'capabl', 'real-tim', 'network', 'product', 'offer', 'becom', 'attract', 'versu', 'use', 'ach', 'method', 'payment', 'today', 'someth', 'financi', 'institut', 'focus', 'take', 'week', 'month', 'evolv', 'next', 'coupl', 'year', 'capabl', 'better', 'exist', 'marketplac', 'think', 'us', 'facilit', 'financi', 'institut', ""n't"", 'infrastructur', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spend', 'direct', 'integr']",Curiosity,"Doubtful, Curiosity, Skepticism",neutral,0.1074,0.0141,0.8785,Curiosity
