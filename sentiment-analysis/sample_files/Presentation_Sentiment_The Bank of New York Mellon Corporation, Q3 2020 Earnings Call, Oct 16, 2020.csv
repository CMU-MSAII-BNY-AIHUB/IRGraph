2,CEO & Director,Thomas P. Gibbons,"Thank you, Magda, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I want to welcome Emily to her first results call as CFO. Most of you are just getting to know Emily. And as you spend more time with her, I think you'll agree that having been in a number of business leadership roles as well as having had experience in the finance function, Emily brings a perspective that positions her exceptionally well for this role. So welcome, Emily, great to have you here. 
Before handing it over to her to review of the financials in more detail, let me touch on some highlights in terms of our performance and other developments. For the third quarter, we reported revenue of $3.85 billion, earnings per share of $0.98 and a solid return on tangible common equity of 17%. Our operating margin was resilient at 30% despite the impact of low interest rates and the related money market fee waivers. And with our share repurchases suspended now for 2 consecutive quarters, we accreted significant capital, increasing our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to 13%. 
During the third quarter, volumes and volatilities continued to normalize. At the same time, interest rates trended a bit lower. As we look into next year, I believe the underlying strength of our franchise will become more apparent as we expect to have most of the run rate impact of lower rates and associated money market fee waivers in our earnings. At that point, we can start to more clearly demonstrate the progress we're making around our key priorities of driving organic growth, optimizing the balance sheet and executing on our efficiency priorities. And notwithstanding the challenging current environment, our business model continues to generate significant excess capital. We look forward to recommencing share buybacks as soon as regulators and market conditions allow, which we expect to be meaningfully accretive to EPS. 
Now there are many opportunities across our business to differentiate ourselves with clients while addressing a broader set of their needs. The crisis has increased the frequency and the intensity of my conversations with clients, as we've helped them navigate related issues. They're adapting to a rapidly changing environment. As they're assessing what they do across their operations, they want to know how we can help them and optimize their data and how to be more efficient and effective in what they do on a day-to-day basis. 
In Asset Servicing, we are winning and retaining more deals, and our pipeline is stronger than it was at this time last year. And I think that's a reflection of the quality of our service as well as the unique set of capabilities that we can deliver for the front, middle and back office. This is, of course, in addition to providing more custody and securities lending. Versus a year ago, we are seeing positive trends in win and retention rates and in our pipeline. Deals are becoming more complex in cross product and solutions based. 
For example, we have recently been selected to provide a range of services by iA Financial Group, that's one of Canada's largest insurance and wealth management groups, with CAD 175 billion in assets under management. The mandate encompasses fund accounting and administration, custody, foreign exchange and a full data and analytics suite of solutions incorporating the data vault and data studio, performance measurement and reporting and middle office services. We're continuing to invest in building out our cloud-based data and analytics offerings and have integrated this into our Asset Servicing core business. 
Clients trust us with $30 trillion of data assets on our software, including trillions where Asset Servicing is elsewhere. And over 20% of our pipeline deals now include data and analytics products. Just one example, which I mentioned last quarter is our new ESG app that allow portfolio managers to create investment portfolios, customized individual ESG preferences using multiple data sources with support from crowd-sourced guidance around preferred ESG factors and priorities. We're seeing real momentum with this app. We have a dozen clients in active trials, and we are in discussions with over 100 more. We're also thinking about how we can integrate capabilities like this when developing holistic solutions for our clients. 
In Pershing, the bulk of money market fee waivers is being absorbed by this business, masking its underlying good performance as the core of long-term drivers remain intact. The pipeline is robust, and the underlying performance of the business is strong. Firms are critically assessing their business model and their cost structures. This is particularly true with self-clearing capital markets firms that are increasingly looking to reduce cost and free up capital by outsourcing their trade settlement and clearing and turning it to us as a result of that. 
Year-to-date, new assets on an annualized basis are strong at over 4%. Our pipeline has further improved with an increase of almost 50% and newly signed business from RIAs who increasingly value our B2B platform, especially as the custodian industry consolidates. We have traditionally served larger RIA practices and are now expanding our addressable market to grow this client base, and we're maintaining our leading market share in the broker-dealer segment. 
In clearance and collateral management, we serviced $3.4 trillion in tri-party assets globally. Our ongoing digital enhancements should continue to drive revenue growth from our existing client base as well as from new clients that are entering the platform as they accelerate their needs to automate operations, access real-time data and focus on process optimization and digitization in this challenging operating environment. Our offerings, which include collateral optimization and advanced analytics solutions, allow clients to move from manual to automated straight through processes while optimizing their global securities inventory, which has proven for them to reduce funding and operating costs and enhance their available liquidity. 
We also expect more clients to convert balances from the bilateral repo and securities lending markets to our tri-party platform as the demand rate remains high for global asset mobility and operational efficiencies that they get on tri-parties. 
Investment and wealth management had solid revenue growth, positive long-term flows and good performance this quarter. Across the 30 comp strategies by revenue, which accounts for about 60% of IM's long-term annualized revenue, 74% of those have pure rankings that are in the top 2 quartile on a 3-year basis. 
Hanneke Smits has now officially started in a role as CEO of Investment Management, and we also recently appointed Jon DeSimone as CEO of Alcentra, one of the world's largest managers of private credit. I am excited to work with him to accelerate our growth by leveraging Alcentra's strengths in Europe and increasing their market position in the U.S. There's an opportunity to grow this manager quite a bit faster. 
Across investment management, we're also investing in technology and in developing offerings in ETFs, ESG and alternatives to align our investment capabilities to evolving client demands. And I think it's going to nicely complement our leading positions in, for example, LDI, active fixed income, global thematic equity as well as private credit. 
In wealth management, client acquisition has started to pick up again with the resumption of socially distanced in-person meetings. We're investing in talent, initiatives such as strengthening our family office -- offering and technology and digital tools to support advisers and their clients. We often speak about the importance of controlling expenses. This is especially critical in this low-rate environment. We continue to identify opportunities to improve automation through operational enhancements. 
Our approach in deciding between reinvesting, expense savings and allowing them to fall to the bottom line is based on a rigorous analysis, including investments and prioritizing them, the ones with the most attractive ROIs as well as taking a careful look at their payback periods. We're also assessing the long-term structural opportunities from this current work environment. There's no question we're going to have a meaningful impact on how we work in the future, and we'll need to be agile. We expect it will impact our real estate footprint, our location strategy, the need for contingency sites, marketing and business development and acceleration of our digitization efforts with our clients. 
Now building a scalable and resilient operating model is a core part of our strategy. It will enable us to optimize and streamline the interactions across our businesses, technology and operations, all in the interest of serving clients and driving growth. 
Now to drive and advance that agenda more rapidly, we recently made the decision to bring operations and technology together under Bridget Engle's leadership by more directly connecting operations and technology into a single operating model. We're taking a holistic approach to bring together the best of both functions. And I think it's going to give us the ability to share enterprise capabilities, prioritize investments, reengineer and digitize processes more quickly to drive scale and agility as well as to embed innovation and automation across end-to-end client journeys and create more agile client-centric teams. 
Now let me turn to capital returns. On September 17th, the Federal Reserve released scenarios for a second round of bank stress test and that was followed by a September 30th announcement that share buyback and dividend increase restrictions have been extended for the fourth quarter. We are now working through the analysis and the modeling as we're given 45 days from the data receipt of the scenarios to submit our plan. We continue to believe that our low-risk and highly capital-generative model positions us very well through this test. We will commence buybacks as soon as possible with the decision to be informed by the economic and regulatory environment at the time as well as the outcome of the resubmitted capital plans based on the new scenarios. In the meantime, we continue to accrete significant amounts of capital. 
The stressed capital buffer, I'll just remind you, gives us flexibility in terms of capital return timing. And so it is a matter of when and not a matter of if. As a reminder, we also opportunistically issued $1 billion in preferred stock during the second quarter, and that will provide us with the opportunity to restack our capital once we can recommence buybacks. We are committed to attractive levels of shareholder returns, and we continue to aim to return at least 100% of earnings to shareholders over time. 
Before I conclude my comments, I want to welcome Robin Vince, who has just joined us as Vice Chairman of BNY Mellon and CEO of Global Market Infrastructure, with oversight of Clearance and Collateral Management, Treasury Services, Markets and Pershing. Bringing these complementary businesses together under his experienced leadership will better position us to become the central facilitator in our clients' capital markets ecosystems across markets, asset classes and geographies. I'm excited to have Robin with us. He is an accomplished and respected leader in the industry, who has held a number of leadership positions at Goldman Sachs, including serving as their Chief Risk Officer, Treasurer, Head of Operations; Head of Global Money Markets and CEO of the International Bank. 
I'm also very pleased with how the leadership team has come together. It's a highly talented, energized and diverse group that is willing to truly challenge each other to make us all stronger. 
To wrap up, while uncertainty certainly lies in terms of how the pandemic evolves and its impact on the global economy, we have also significant uncertainty about the size and form of future stimulus programs as well as political developments. But given that, I am certain that the team we have in place will continue to navigate these challenges by executing on our strategic priorities. I am also proud that our employees across the company have worked diligently throughout this unprecedented time to provide great client service. We entered this crisis from a position of strength and have an unwavering focus on building ever-greater value for our stakeholders going forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Emily.","[([0.2179068922996521], [0.018123945221304893], [0.7639691829681396]), ([0.207734152674675], [0.0133825009688735], [0.7788833379745483]),

"
0,Chief Financial Officer,Emily Hope Portney,"Thank you, Todd, for the kind introduction, and good morning, everyone. Let me run through the details of our results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. 
Beginning on Page 2 of the financial highlights document. In the third quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $3.85 billion, down less than 1%, and EPS of $0.98. As expected, revenues were negatively impacted by low interest rates and associated money market fee waivers. Excluding these market-driven factors, underlying fees would have been up, reflecting good momentum across many of our businesses. Expenses were up 4%. However, it is important to note that 3% of the increase was driven by the tax-related reserve release in the third quarter of 2019. Pretax margin was 30%, and we posted ROTCE of 16.7% and ROE of 8.7%. Provision for credit losses was $9 million. 
We continue to accrete substantial excess capital and are in a good position to resume buybacks when regulators and market conditions allow. Quarter-over-quarter, both our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios improved meaningfully by 40 and 30 basis points, respectively. 
Page 3 sets out a trend analysis of the main drivers of the quarterly results. Investment services revenue was $2.9 billion, down 4%. Net interest revenue was down 11% while fees were down 2%, including the impact of money market fee waivers. We saw a healthy underlying growth across Asset Servicing, Pershing, Treasury Services and Corporate Trust, which I will discuss later. Investment and wealth management revenue increased 3%, largely driven by higher market value, and we also continue to see strong investment performance in our largest strategies with positive long-term flows this quarter. 
The impact of money market fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of distribution and servicing expense was $101 million in the quarter, slightly better than the $110 million to $125 million that we previously guided to and an increase of $22 million quarter-on-quarter. We provided you detail of the impact by business and the expense in the appendix of this highlight deck. Finally, despite the contraction in high margin revenues this year from lower interest rates and more recently, the absence of share buybacks, pretax income, margins and EPS are healthy, although down versus a year ago. 
Slide 4 summarizes the P&L and notable items in the year ago period. There were 2 largely offsetting items but relevant as we look at various components of the P&L.; one is the lease impairment negatively impacting NIR in the third quarter of 2019; and the other is a net reduction of reserves that benefited IM expense in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimums. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled just over $21 billion at September 30, and our CET1 ratio was 13% under the advanced approach and 13.5% under the standardized approach. As a reminder, under the new stressed capital buffer rule that became effective October 1, we are required to maintain a standardized CET1 ratio of 8.5%, including the 2.5% stressed capital buffer floor and a 1.5% G-SIB surcharge. 
Tier 1 leverage is currently our binding constraint due to the buffers we need to hold for potential growth in our deposit base-driven balance sheet. We are comfortable operating at a ratio of around 5.5% to 6% versus the 4% regulatory minimum. At 6.5%, our current Tier 1 leverage ratio is well above our target, and we expect to accrete more capital in the fourth quarter. Finally, our average LCR in the third quarter was 111%. 
In terms of shareholder capital return, in the third quarter, we continued our suspension of share repurchases and will do so again in the fourth quarter in line with Federal Reserve restrictions for CCAR banks. We continued to pay our quarterly cash dividend, which totaled $279 million in the third quarter and believe we have ample capacity to continue to pay dividends under a variety of economic scenarios. 
Turning to Page 6. My comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest revenue of $703 million was down 10%. This was within the range we provided with the second quarter results despite rates coming in a little lower than was implied by the forward curve at the time. We offset some of this impact through implementation of balance sheet optimization strategies. A full quarter of lower LIBOR as well as lower rates in general reduced the yield on securities portfolio, loans and other interest-earning assets. For example, average 1- and 3-month LIBOR levels were down 20 and 36 bps, respectively. The lower asset yield impact was partially offset by the related benefits of lower funding costs. 
The rate environment also drove MBS prepayment activity slightly higher than expected for the quarter. As I said, we were able to offset some of the rate headwinds through the deployment of cash into a larger securities portfolio as more of our deposit balances seasoned. Additionally, we benefited from a decline in long-term debt outstanding. 
Turning to Slide 7, which summarizes deposits and securities trends. Average deposit balance has remained strong at $279 million, up 23% versus the third quarter of 2019. Deposit growth reflects the success of our deposit initiatives linked to fee-generating transaction activities that we've had in place for a year now across Treasury Services, Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. It is also partly attributable to Central Bank balance sheet expansion, which results in excess liquidity in the system. 
The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declined very modestly to negative 5 basis points during the quarter and reflected some pricing optimization in a few businesses. At this point, we generally feel that we've now reached the low point for deposit pricing. Recall that the negative rate page reflects our business mix. Approximately 25% of our deposits are non-U.S. dollar, and we charge negative rates on euro-denominated deposits. 
Turning to the securities portfolio. On average, the portfolio increased approximately $9 billion versus the second quarter and was around $37 billion over the prior year or nearly 30% higher as we have deployed the growing deposit base. Average non-HQLA securities, including trading assets, were $33 billion in the third quarter, up from $22 billion a year ago, as we've been buying some incremental non-HQLA securities to increase yields while maintaining our conservative risk profile. 
Moving to Page 8, which provides some color on our asset mix and our loan portfolio. Our average interest-earning assets were relatively stable at $358 billion. But as I mentioned, we did redeploy some cash into investment securities this quarter. The loan portfolio represents just 15% of our interest-earning assets. We continue to feel good about our credit exposures, and the portfolio continues to perform well, still at 0 net charge-offs this year. We will continue to closely monitor the portfolio, particularly the commercial real estate exposure and other sectors more acutely impacted by the current environment. 
Provision for credit losses reflected a fairly consistent macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter and a modest net uptick in reserves primarily related to our CRE portfolio. 
Page 9 provides an overview of expenses. Expenses of $2.7 billion were up 4%. 3% of the increase was driven by the tax-related reserve reduction last year in investment management. The remainder of the increase was the result of continued investments in technology and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower staff and business development expenses, namely Travel and Marketing. 
Turning to Page 10. Total Investment Services revenue declined 4% as almost all business revenue growth rates were impacted by year-over-year lower net interest revenue. Assets under custody and/or administration increased 8% year-over-year to $38.6 trillion, and we continue to see organic growth with new and existing clients as well as the benefit from higher market values and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. As I move to the business line discussion, I will focus my comments on fees. 
Within Asset Servicing, overall fees increased slightly, primarily on organic growth with existing clients and higher market levels. These increases were partially offset by lower securities lending revenue due to tighter spreads as well as marginally lower foreign exchange revenue on the back of lower industry volumes despite higher volatility in FX markets. 
Other trading revenue was down, driven by fixed income trading activities, which is offset in NIR. In Pershing, fee revenue decreased as the impact of fee waivers more than offset good organic growth. Transaction volumes, clearing accounts, mutual fund assets and sweep balances all increased, and net new assets were $12 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date, the pipeline has further improved as the business continues to gain momentum. 
Issuer Services fees revenue decreased by 9%, driven by Depositary Receipts based on the slowdown in cross-border settlement as well as seasonal dividend and other corporate action activity due to macro uncertainty. 
Trends in DR masked good underlying momentum in Corporate Trust as demonstrated by new business wins and client deposit growth, and corporate trust fees were modestly higher. 
Treasury Services fee revenue was up 9% despite the tough macroeconomic environment and lower overall payment activity, primarily due to higher liquidity balances, which grew over 45% year-over-year, net new business and an improvement in product mix. 
Clearance and Collateral Management fees were impacted by lower revenue of $12 million, driven by the divestiture of an equity investment in the fourth quarter of last year as well as subdued activity in the U.S. treasury market despite higher issuance levels as secondary trading and, therefore, settlement activity was lower. These headwinds were partially offset by higher non-U.S. dollar collateral management fees. 
Page 11 summarizes the drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our investment services businesses. 
Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 12. Total Investment and Wealth Management revenue was up 3%. Overall assets under management of $2 trillion are up 9% year-over-year, primarily due to higher markets, the impact of U.S. dollar weakening and cash inflows from earlier this year. We had net outflows of $5 billion in the quarter, the long-term strategies had net inflows of $5 billion, including significant LDI inflows from targeted clients. 
Investment Management revenue was up 5%, driven mainly by higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and uptick in performance fees and the absence of the impact of hedging activity that occurred a year ago. This offset higher money market fee waivers. Wealth Management revenue was down 1% year-over-year while fees were flat as higher market levels were offset by net outflows, partially due to client tax payments and a shift by clients to lower fee investment products. In the quarter, there were $21 million of seed capital hedging losses that were more than offset by gains on seed capital. The net of these items are reflected in other fee revenue within the segment. 
As a reminder, in the consolidated financial statements, the results of the seed capital hedges are in foreign exchange and other trading and the seed capital gains are reflected in income from consolidated investment management funds and investment in other income. 
In the third quarter last year, there was also a revenue hedged in one of the investment management boutiques, which has since been eliminated. 
Now turning to our other segment on Page 13. The year-over-year revenue comparison was primarily impacted by the lease-related impairment of $70 million recorded in the third quarter of last year while expenses declined primarily due to lower staff expense. 
And now a few comments about the fourth quarter. First, I would note that the macroeconomic environment remains fluid. Although we are expecting higher volatility in the fourth quarter around the election, it is difficult to predict whether this will translate into higher transaction volumes or whether there will be a risk-off environment. 
Looking ahead at net interest revenue, we expect NIR to decline sequentially by 3% to 5%. As we look into next year, we expect the quarterly NIR run rate to be slightly less than the fourth quarter level. This is based on a few factors. First, the forward curve indicates a fairly stable rate environment from here, implying that the work should be behind us. Second, we continue to take action and optimize the securities and loan portfolio as deposit season, generating marginally higher yields. Third, the unrealized gains associated with the higher-yielding long-term securities will take some time to roll off. Fourth, we do not expect further deleveraging. And additionally, our deposit balances remain strong and are slightly higher than the third quarter average. We expect them to remain at these levels. 
In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect money market fee waivers, net of distribution expense benefits, to be in the original range indicated of $135 million to $150 million. As we look into the next year, we expect the waivers to be fully incorporated into our run rate at the higher end of that range. Waivers will also start to impact Investment Services businesses aside from Pershing to a greater extent. 
And on full year expenses, excluding notable items, we expect this to remain essentially flat versus 2019, including the 50 basis point full year-over-year impact from higher pension expense. They may be up slightly if there is a weakening of the U.S. dollar, but this, of course, would be largely offset on the revenue line, which would benefit from a weakening U.S. dollar. 
Credit costs will be highly dependent upon individual credit and other macroeconomic developments. In terms of our effective tax rate, we still look to be approximately 20% for the full year, although it was lower this quarter. 
With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions?","[([0.35153353214263916], [0.015582103282213211], [0.6328843832015991]), ([0.03426323086023331], [0.025058044120669365],

The classified negative sentences are: (1) 85 billion, down less than 1%, and EPS of $0. (2) As expected, revenues were negatively impacted by low interest rates and associated money market fee waivers. (3) 9 billion, down 4%. (4) Net interest revenue was down 11% while fees were down 2%, including the impact of money market fee waivers. (5) Finally, despite the contraction in high margin revenues this year from lower interest rates and more recently, the absence of share buybacks, pretax income, margins and EPS are healthy, although down versus a year ago. (6) ; one is the lease impairment negatively impacting NIR in the third quarter of 2019; and the other is a net reduction of reserves that benefited IM expense in the prior year quarter. (7) Turning to Slide 5. (8) Net interest revenue of $703 million was down 10%. (9) A full quarter of lower LIBOR as well as lower rates in general reduced the yield on securities portfolio, loans and other interest-earning assets. (10) For example, average 1- and 3-month LIBOR levels were down 20 and 36 bps, respectively.
