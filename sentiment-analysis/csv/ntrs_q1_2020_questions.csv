0,3,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division",Alexander  Blostein,"So I wanted to start with your guys' thoughts around the organic fee growth in the current environment. So I think in the past, you talked about low to mid-single-digit growth across institutional and wealth businesses. So wondering how the current sales cycle likely being extended. How is that impacting the fee growth outlook from an organic basis? 
And as a kind of follow-up to that, obviously, importantly, I want to get your thoughts on expenses as well. Again, similarly, you talked about aligning expense growth with organic fee growth, again, sort of call it 3% to 5% range. How low can you guys take that given the current environment? And any thoughts around 2020 expense growth would be helpful."
1,9,"Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division",Glenn Paul Schorr,"Wonder if I could ask a question, I could use them both on this on the provision and the loan book. So if you could talk generically what type of economic backdrop, you wrote that provision to because the world was changing a lot right around quarter end. And then if we could talk about the loan book that produce most of that. I'm assuming it's almost all-in C&I and CRE. So maybe you could talk about what in, say, office, retail and construction, where that is derived from? How much of it is clients that are across the firm versus some things that are syndicated? I really appreciate. We normally don't have much discussion about your loan book."
2,12,"BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",Michael Roger Carrier,"First, can you provide a bit more color on the net interest income outlook, particularly given the rise in deposits, and expectations in this backdrop with a lot of liquidity out there? And then for the NIM, just how you're thinking about the portfolio and reinvestment rates?"
3,6,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",Brian Bertram Bedell,"Maybe just staying with the balance sheet for a minute on that LIBOR-to-IOER spread. I guess they're down. They're 7% to 10% down. Is that considering current LIBOR -- 1-month LIBOR rates? Or that -- or are you factoring in LIBOR to compress further with that? 
And if you could just remind us again on the loan repricing mechanism, I think it's 3/4 of loans repriced quarterly to 1-month LIBOR with the rest lagged for 1 year, if you could just remind us on that."
4,10,"Jefferies LLC, Research Division",Kenneth Michael Usdin,"On the balance sheet, Jason, can you talk through where the floating/fixed mix is of the balance sheet right now, what the duration of the portfolio is? And just how do you decide, based on your prior response, about the ins and outs of deposits where you're going with reinvestment yields so much lower in terms of the asset side of earning assets distribution?"
5,11,"Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division",Michael Lawrence Mayo,"Just my question was answered, but just one follow-up. You said 90% of people are working from home. Can you elaborate more on what sort of more permanent business model change that might lead to?"
6,13,"Wolfe Research, LLC",Steven Joseph Chubak,"So you noted earlier in a question relating to credit that you have lower exposure to the higher-risk industry categories. Given some of the stress in energy markets, I was hoping you could speak to any direct exposure to the energy sector, maybe what specific energy categories, in particular, such as E&P, midstream, et cetera."
7,5,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",Brennan  Hawken,"First question is a follow-up on the expenses. So you talked about some of the actions taken. You helped us understand the pieces that were subject to volumes and when I take a look at the midpoint of that, I think you said it was outside services and equipment and software, 30% to 40%. 
So if you take the midpoint, that's about 10% of your annual expenses, does that mean that things outside of that bucket of expenses you're going to be able to calibrate? And the -- that 10%, we should grow maybe at an elevated rate, given some of the things that are going on? Can you help us think about what, at least logically, might come into play when we try to calibrate how to forecast your expense growth for the year?"
8,7,"Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division",Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl,"I hear what you're saying about the NII being down in the second quarter, but how do you think about it then after the second quarter? Is there a period of time that the liabilities will catch up on the repricing side? And kind of how we think about deposit betas moving forward?"
9,6,"Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",Brian Bertram Bedell,"Great. Just wanted to just go over that, the pricing on the custody business and the Wealth Management business. I know the mix has changed over time because you've been servicing more people on the administrative basis, particularly in alternatives, and that's created a little bit more of an averaging mix than it used to be historically. 
But if you could just review within the C&IS asset servicing business, what portion of that book is priced on a quarter-end lag versus more of an averaging basis? And then just same within Wealth Management, what portion of that is priced on that 1-month lag, I think the custody part of that that you don't manage in Wealth Management? I think that's on a prior quarter lag, if I'm not mistaken. So if you're able to just review that price [ difference ]."
10,4,"Morgan Stanley, Research Division",Betsy Lynn Graseck,"I had 2 questions. One, just on the comments that you made earlier in the call around the medium-term caution in the pipeline, could you just give us a sense as to the drivers of that? And how long you think that -- what your view of medium-term is? 
And then maybe you could give us a sense as to this is really just a push out, not an evaporation. So maybe you could speak to how that comes back into your run rate as things open up."
11,8,"RBC Capital Markets, Research Division",Gerard S. Cassidy,"I'd like to follow up on the credit comments. Northern Trust is obviously very well-regarded when it comes to credit. You guys have done a phenomenal job in the last 20 years. It was interesting in 2001, there was exposure to Enron, which surprised everybody that Northern would have that kind of credit. 
And what we discovered was as part of the employment benefits processing that you did for Enron, you were asked to join the revolver line what they did at the time. Are there any of those outside situations today that we just wouldn't expect Northern to have a credit exposure? I'm not asking for specific names, but just to XYZ companies like, ""Wow, how did that happen?"" is there any of that on the books today versus what it was in '01?"
12,5,"UBS Investment Bank, Research Division",Brennan  Hawken,"Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Just quick on fee waivers. Could you give us the breakdown of your money fund AUM mix in between prime, Govi and muni?"
13,13,"Wolfe Research, LLC",Steven Joseph Chubak,"I just want to make sure, it's a quick modeling question. The other income line, there was a lot of noise this quarter. As we think about the right jumping off point for 2Q, given with some of the BOLI tailwinds, how should we be thinking about the appropriate run rate beginning in the second quarter?"
14,0,CFO & Executive VP,Jason Jerrome Tyler,"Great. And really quick, I'm going to save Mark a follow-up call because I do have the AUM breakout. So cash AUM at about $235 billion at period-end. Fixed income, about $150 billion and some of lump index and active equity at about 4.25% and then call the rest other and leave it there."
