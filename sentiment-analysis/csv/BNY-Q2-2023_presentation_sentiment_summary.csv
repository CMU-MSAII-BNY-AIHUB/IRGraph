2,"President, CEO & Director",Robin Antony Vince,"Thanks, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Dermot will walk you through the financials for the quarter shortly. But in summary, the company delivered good financial performance amid a very dynamic operating environment, and we've continued taking actions to position the firm for higher underlying growth and enhanced operational efficiency over time. 
Referring to Slide 2 of our financial highlights presentation, BNY Mellon reported second quarter earnings per share of $1.30, which was up 26% year-over-year on $4.5 billion of revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Consistent with our focus on driving pretax margin expansion in 2023 and beyond, we drove meaningful positive operating leverage as we maintained strong expense discipline while continuing to make significant investments to improve our growth trajectory and transform our operating model. As a result, our pretax margin improved to 30%, and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 23% in the quarter. As I've said many times before, disciplined execution and consistent progress from milestone to milestone is the key to unlocking the financial opportunity inherent in our high-quality franchise. While we're conscious of the work ahead of us, we're pleased to see the momentum building across the company. 
First, we're getting an increasingly firm grip on our expense base. I'm proud of our people who are embracing the task of making BNY Mellon a more efficient and scalable company, which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver tangible results in 2023 and beyond. 
Remember, in January, we committed to essentially cut expense growth in half this year, roughly 4% growth excluding notable items in 2023 compared to roughly 8% ex currency in 2022. Halfway through the year, I'm pleased to report that we're on track, even a little ahead of our plans. 
Second, the strength of our balance sheet, the resiliency of our business model and our proactive balance sheet management continue to differentiate us with clients and create value for our shareholders. Net interest revenue and deposits were both bright spots in the quarter, and the Federal Reserve's 2023 bank stress test demonstrated our capacity to withstand an extreme stress scenario. As a result of the test, our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement remains at the regulatory floor of 2.5%. And while our overall approach to returning capital to shareholders remains unchanged, we increased our quarterly common dividend by 14% to $0.42 starting this quarter. 
Third, we remain laser-focused on driving sustainably higher underlying growth across the firm. We've talked before about the advantages of our business model. Businesses such as Clearance and Collateral Management, Pershing, Depositary Receipts, Corporate Trust and Treasury Services offer us a breadth and diversification in comparison to traditional trust banks. 
We saw strength in some of these differentiated businesses in the second quarter, and new business pipelines are healthy across the board. And importantly, we continued pushing ahead with new innovative client solutions that we expect to become growth accelerators for the medium and long term. 
Less than 2 years after hiring employee #1, Pershing X is now live with Wove, our open architecture wealth management platform that addresses a major pain point in the advisory market by better integrating advisers' core applications. 
Wove allows us to integrate some of the best solutions from around BNY Mellon, including from our Investment Management business as well as from leading third-party fintechs. Our launch at Pershing's INSITE Conference in June has garnered significant early enthusiasm from clients and industry influencers who see Wove as a promising solution. The client pipeline is growing nicely, which we will report on more in the quarters ahead. 
More broadly, Wove is a proof point of our ability to execute at speed. We can deliver leading solutions quickly when we empower our people, surround them with the expertise and tools that they need and drive forward with a product mindset, leveraging our great platforms. It's also a reflection of the change in mindset we are cultivating here, more commercially oriented with a greater sense of ownership and a greater focus on execution. 
I'll also call out Treasury Services, which continues to innovate in areas like faster payments and Banking as a Service. This quarter, the business announced a strategic alliance with Mobility Capital Finance or MoCaFi, a Black-founded fintech whose mission is to enable underserved communities to access banking services. This is just the latest example of how we are deploying our capabilities to advance financial inclusion in an innovative way. 
Now I've spoken in the past about the opportunity to do more things for our clients by connecting the dots for them through our 1BNY Mellon initiative and how we're going to operationalize that. To help us realize this potential and more broadly, to sharpen our commercial focus and elevate the client experience across the firm, in May, we welcomed Cathinka Wahlstrom as our first Chief Commercial Officer and member of our Executive Committee. In addition to taking on oversight responsibilities for Global Client Management, I've tasked Cathinka to embed 1BNY Mellon into the operations of our company. It's important that we commercialize this opportunity through training, by properly incentivizing our people to collaborate across the firm and by developing deliberate approaches to multiproduct solutions. 
Stepping back for a moment, let me provide a few thoughts on the macro environment. We acknowledge that the path of interest rates, continued QT and elevated U.S. Treasury issuance activity carry meaningful uncertainties for the environment in the months ahead. 
From our vantage point as the primary clearer of U.S. Treasuries and through touching roughly 20% of the world's investable assets, our data tells us that more than half of recent T-bill issuance has been absorbed by funds flowing out of the Fed's RRP, but a good chunk of the balance has come from the banking system. 
Most of the money market fund demand for T-bills has been concentrated at the very front end as funds have been less comfortable extending duration past the end of July, ahead of an expected rate hike later this month and continued uncertainty on the path of rates thereafter. 
We're also not seeing much foreign demand as cross-border flows into U.S. Treasuries of all maturities are negative and have been for some time. Together, this is likely going to put some incremental pressure on domestic funding sources funds, banks and corporates as well as state and local governments to absorb upcoming supply unless T-bill prices cheapen materially from current levels. For this reason, we do expect some further pressure on deposit balances across the industry in the months ahead. As you would expect, we are positioning ourselves prudently given these uncertainties but see these flows as benefiting our broader cash ecosystem. 
We manage over $1.3 trillion worth of cash on behalf of clients across deposits, money market funds, repos and securities lending. And we're the biggest provider of collateral services globally as well with about $6 trillion of tri-party balances on our platform. This $7 trillion of relevance to money market flows allows us to retain a connection to the money when it moves around various short-term investment alternatives and allows us to help our clients find the right solutions for their investment needs. 
Let me conclude my comments on a reflective note. As I've acknowledged before, strategy matters, but execution and culture matter * even more. As we close the books on the second quarter, we're entering the back half of the year with good momentum and confidence *in our ability to drive change by executing consistently and at pace. 
Over the past couple of years, we've been able to attract high-caliber talent to upgrade multiple important roles across the company. Our existing team, together with these new leaders, are rising to the challenge of unlocking our potential. And it's clear to me that we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us by leveraging our unique combination of businesses, our preeminent client franchise and the power of our culture and people. I'm encouraged by the initial progress over the past couple of quarters and excited about what lies ahead. 
With that, over to you, Dermot.","[([0.4186753034591675], [0.017740001901984215], [0.5635847449302673]), ([0.03982728347182274], [0.018250463530421257], [0.9419222474098206]), ([0.9540059566497803],

0,Senior Executive VP & CFO,Dermot William McDonogh,"Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Page 3 of the presentation with some additional details on our consolidated financial results in the second quarter. 
Total revenue of $4.5 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Net interest revenue was up 33% year-over-year primarily driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix. Fee revenue was down 2% driven by the sale of Alcentra in the fourth quarter, the mix of cumulative AUM net inflows and lower FX revenue on the back of lower volumes and volatility, partially offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers. 
Firm-wide AUC/A of $46.9 trillion increased by 9% year-over-year. This increase reflects the impact of higher market values, client inflows and net new business. Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 2% year-over-year. The impact of lower market values driven by a year-over-year decrease in the U.K. fixed income markets and the sale of Alcentra was partially offset by cumulative net inflows over the last year and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. 
Investment and other revenue was $97 million. We continue to see strength in fixed income trading and positive seed capital results. Expenses were flat on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items. This was driven by higher investments and revenue-related expenses and the impact of inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings and the Alcentra divestiture. 
Provision for credit losses was $5 million in the quarter, reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast, resulting in higher reserves relating to commercial real estate, largely offset by reserve releases related to financial institutions. As Robin mentioned earlier, earnings per share were $1.30, up 26% year-over-year or up 20% excluding notable items. Pretax margin continued to improve to 30%. Our return on tangible common equity improved to 23%. 
Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our regulatory capital ratios remained roughly unchanged. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7%, down 14 basis points quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by an increase in average assets. Tier 1 capital increased slightly driven by capital generated through earnings net of capital returns through buybacks and dividends. The CET1 ratio was 11.1%, up 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter primarily reflecting higher CET1 capital. 
As we said on our earnings call in April, we tapered buybacks in the second quarter to maintain conservative buffers above our management targets being mindful of the uncertain environment. Overall, we returned 72% of earnings, including approximately $300 million of common dividends and approximately $450 million of buybacks in the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 119% of earnings. 
The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 120%, an increase of 2 percentage points compared with the prior quarter. Our consolidated net stable funding ratio, which we are reporting publicly for the first time this quarter, was 136%, well in excess of the regulatory requirement. 
Moving on to net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I will describe in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1.1 billion was down 2% quarter-over-quarter driven by deposit mix shift, partially offset by higher interest rates. Overall, deposit balances have remained elevated relative to our expectations, as they increased 1% sequentially on an average basis. Interest-bearing deposits were up 5%. Noninterest-bearing deposits were down 11%, in line with our expectations. Average interest-earning assets increased by 4% quarter-over-quarter. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo was up 15%. Loan balances were flat. Our investment securities portfolio was down 5%. 
Turning to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were flat year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items relating to litigation and severance. As I mentioned earlier, this reflects higher investments and revenue-related expenses and the impact of inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings and the Alcentra divestiture. 
To summarize, we continue pushing forward with our multiyear investments to increase the growth trajectory of the firm and transform our operating model for greater scalability over time. Importantly, we remain focused on driving positive operating leverage and delivering continued pretax margin expansion. As an example of the expense discipline that Robin mentioned, for the second quarter, we self-funded the entirety of our incremental investment spend and importantly, are on course to do the same for the full year. 
Turning to our business segments, starting with Securities Services on Page 7. As I discuss the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will comment on the investment services fees for each line of business described in our Earnings Press Release and the Financial Supplement. 
Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 2%. Within this, investment services fees were flat. FX revenue was down 20% on the back of lower volatility and volume. Net interest revenue was up 46%. 
In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were flat with healthy underlying growth from new and existing clients, offset by lower client transaction activity, reflecting the current market environment. Importantly, strength in attractive market segments continued. Despite an industry slowdown for private markets and hedge fund launches, we saw strong growth in our Alts servicing business. High single-digit growth in both ETF AUC/A and number of funds serviced continued. 
Within Issuer Services, investment service fees were up 3% driven by our Depositary Receipts business. Here, the impact of a large client corporate action in the current quarter was tempered by the absence of Russia-related client activity in the second quarter of last year. 
Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%. Net interest revenue increased by 24%. 
In Pershing, investment services fees were up 4%. The increase reflects the abatement of money market fee waivers and higher fees on sweep balances, partially offset by lower transaction volumes, consistent with the decline in U.S. equity exchange volumes and the impact of lost business. 
The net new assets number was a negative $34 billion in the quarter, reflecting the deconversion of a regional bank client that was acquired in May. Excluding the impact of this ongoing deconversion, which we expect to weigh on our reported net new assets for several quarters, net new assets grew at a mid-single-digit annualized growth rate. We remain confident in Pershing's underlying momentum and prospects. Importantly, our continued investments to enhance Pershing's core platform as well as the business' access to the strength and breadth of the whole company is being recognized by clients as a differentiator, especially in the current market environment. Also, as Robin mentioned earlier, Wove is off to an excellent start. 
In Treasury Services, investment services fees decreased by 2%, reflecting higher earnings credits for noninterest-bearing deposit balances and lower payment volumes, partially offset by continued momentum across payment and liquidity solutions. 
In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 10% driven by U.S. government clearance volumes reflecting elevated volatility and U.S. Treasury issuance following resolution of the debt ceiling. We also saw healthy growth in collateral management fees. As the largest truly global collateral manager, we continue to increase market connectivity by expanding our tri-party platform to include new markets, trade types and collateral pools. Our average tri-party collateral management balances increased by 16% year-over-year to $6 trillion. 
Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $813 million, down 10% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 10%. Investment and other revenue was $12 million in the quarter primarily reflecting seed capital gains, and net interest revenue declined 37% year-over-year. 
Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 2% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, this decrease largely reflects lower market values driven by the year-over-year decrease in U.K. fixed income markets and the Alcentra divestiture, partially offset by cumulative net inflows and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar. In the quarter, we saw $9 billion of net outflows from long-term products as clients continued to derisk and rebalance their portfolios. And despite competitive investment performance, we saw $9 billion of net outflows from cash. 
In Investment Management, revenue was down 9% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the sale of Alcentra and the mix of cumulative net inflows, partially offset by improved seed capital results and lower money market fee waivers. While in Wealth Management, revenue decreased 10% driven by lower net interest revenue and changes in product mix. Client assets of $286 billion increased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. 
Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment. I will close with a few comments on our current financial outlook for the second half of the year. Number one, our net interest revenue outlook for the full year '23 remains unchanged for 20% growth year-over-year. This is based on market-implied forward interest rates towards the end of the quarter. We are pleased with our net interest revenue trajectory and balance sheet management year-to-date, but mindful that we are operating in a very uncertain environment with continued rate volatility, a higher for longer rates market backdrop and uncertainty surrounding meaningful U.S. Treasury issuance in the coming months. 
Number two, we are ahead of plan when it comes to executing on our efficiency efforts. We remain focused on outperforming our target of 4% expense growth excluding notable items for the full year '23 and will work hard to drive this closer to 3% in the coming months. While we expect the operating environment to continue to weigh on fee growth relative to what we expected at the beginning of the year, our progress on the expense side continues to give us confidence in our ability to deliver positive operating leverage this year. 
Number three, we still expect to return 100% of our earnings or more to our shareholders over the full year '23 while continuing to position ourselves conservatively with respect to our capital levels, considering the amount of operating uncertainty. 
In conclusion, I am pleased to report that the company continues to perform well against the backdrop of complex operating environment, and we continue to execute with a great sense of urgency against our growth and efficiency initiatives. 
With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A?","[([0.15950359404087067], [0.018644608557224274], [0.8218518495559692]), ([0.028370635583996773], [0.022736666724085808],

(22) While in Wealth Management, revenue decreased 10% driven by lower net interest revenue and changes in product mix. (23) Number one, our net interest revenue outlook for the full year '23 remains unchanged for 20% growth year-over-year.
